abstract = {Fracture in rock is a major factor that affects the rock's elastic properties. Elastic properties can be measured statically during slow loading of a specimen, or dynamically, where the elasticity can be calculated using elastic-wave velocity. However, differences exist between the static and dynamic elastic properties. In this study, the dynamic and static elastic properties were measured under varying effective pressures and differential loads for dry and water-saturated Westerly granite that was thermally treated to 250, 450, 650 and 850 °C. Increasing the temperature produces an increased fracture density that is isotropically distributed. Increased fracture density results in a reduction in the Young's modulus and an increase in the Poisson's ratio, in both the static and dynamic cases, and is very significant for rocks treated above 450 °C. The dynamic Young's modulus is larger than the static value and the difference between them increases when water saturated. Under dry conditions, the static Young's modulus shows good correlation with dynamic values regardless of fracture density, loading or effective pressure. The static and dynamic Poisson's ratio are close to each other under both dry and saturated conditions. However, deviation between the static and dynamic Poisson's ratio occurs when the fracture density is high, differential load is high and effective pressure is low.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments have been performed on samples of Westerly granite in which the differential stress was repeatedly cycled to 85% of the intact sample strength. The experiments have shown that under uniaxial conditions the onset of dilatancy is reduced to fairly low stress; however, under triaxial condi-tions dilatancy can be an' apparently stable process, and the onset of dilatancy is not affected by the re-peated cycling. Thus the implication for midcrustal earthquakes is that the onset of dilatancy repeatedly occurs at relatively high stress levels. For example, our results indicate that at typical focal depths of 2.5 and l0 km (corresponding to effective hydrostatic pressures of about 500 and 2000 bars) the onset of dilatancy repeatedly occurs at 1.8 and 3.0 kbar of differential compressive stress, respectively.},

In addition an experiment on one sample of Toki Granite at 40 MPa confining pressure was performed, in order to compare and elucidate the structural effects. Using acoustic emission data, strain measurements and elastic wave velocities allow to define consistently a damage domain in the stress space. In this domain, microcracking develops. The microcracking process is, in a first stage, homogeneous and, close to failure, localized. Elastic wave velocities decrease in the damage domain and elastic anisotropy develops. Using KACHANOV's model (1993), elastic wave velocities have been inverted to derive the full second-order crack density tensor and characterize the fluid saturation state from the fourth-order crack density tensor. Crack density is strongly anisotropic and the total crack density close to failure slightly above one. The results indicate that the rock is saturated in agreement with the experimental conditions. The model is thus shown to be very appropriate to infer from elastic wave velocities a complete quantitative characterization of the damaged rock.},

abstract = {Limestone samples were deformed up to 5% inelastic axial strain at an effective confining pressure P eff =50 MPa in the cataclastic flow regime and subsequently maintained under constant static stress conditions (either isostatic of triaxial) for extended periods of time while elastic wave speeds and permeability were continuously monitored. During deformation, both seismic wave speeds and permeability decrease with increasing strain, due to the growth of subvertical microcracks and inelastic porosity reduction. During the static hold period under water-saturated conditions, the seismic wave speeds recovered gradually, typically by around 5% (relative to their initial value) after 2 days, while permeability remained constant. The recovery in wave speed increases with increasing confining pressure but decreases with increasing applied differential stress. The recovery is markedly lower when the samples are saturated with an inert fluid as opposed to water. The evolution in wave speed is interpreted quantitatively in terms of microcrack density, which shows that the post-deformation recovery is associated with a decrease in effective microcrack length, typically of the order to 10% after 2 days. The proposed mechanism for the observed damage recovery is microcrack closure due to a combination of backsliding on wing cracks driven by time-dependent friction and closure due to pressure solution at contacts between propping particles or asperities and microcrack walls. The recovery rates observed in the experiments, and the proposed underlying mechanisms, are compatible with seismological observations of seismic wave speed recovery along faults following earthquakes.},

Rising fluid pressure due to pore fluid flow and the resulting Coulomb stress changes were found to be strongly correlated with the time and location of aftershock events. Regional aftershock frequencies computed by integrating pore pressure decay rates also agreed quite well with aftershock data. Calculations show that regions of rising postseismic poroelastic Coulomb stress overlap considerably with regions of positive coseismic Coulomb stress. Thus pore fluid flow, which affects pore pressure within faults and causes regional poroelastic stress evolution following earthquakes, gradually evolves the initial coseismic stress changes. Together these changes provide a reasonable physical mechanism for aftershock triggering which agrees with data for the 1992 Landers earthquake.},

However, for an anisotropic rock the deviatoric stress can induce an undrained pore pressure change, a consequence that does not happen under the assumption of isotropy. Experimental techniques have been aimed at making reliable measurements of Skempton's coefficients taking into account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage system. Special attention has been dedicated to full saturation with the use of the back pressure technique. The hydrostatic compression experiment has been utilized to confirm the anisotropy of the bulk and solid phases of the rock. The conventional triaxial compression experiment has been performed on transversely isotropic rock where independent loading is applied perpendicular and parallel to bedding directions and the correspondent changes in pore pressure in the specimen are recorded. This has lead to interesting observations on the connections between the directional-dependent solid and bulk response of rock.},

Here a rock specimen of Westerly granite was submitted to differential stress cycles (i.e., loading and unloading) of increasing amplitudes, up to failure and under upper crustal conditions. Combined records of strains, acoustic emissions, and P and S elastic wave anisotropies demonstrate that increasing differential stress promotes crack opening, sliding, and propagation subparallel to the main compressive stress orientation. However, the significant elastic anisotropies observed during loading (≥20%) almost vanish upon stress removal, demonstrating that in the absence of stress, crack-related elastic anisotropy remains limited (≤10%). As a consequence, (i) crack-related elastic anisotropies measured in the crust will likely be a strong function of the level of differential stress, and consequently (ii) continuous monitoring of elastic wave velocity anisotropy along faults could shed light on the mechanism of stress accumulation during interseismic loading.},

abstract = {Microfractures are small, high-aspect-ratio cracks in rock that result from application of differential stresses. Although the term has been used to refer to larger features in the petroleum engineering and geophysics literature, in geologic parlance the term refers to fractures visible only under magnification, having lengths of millimeters or less and widths generally less than 0.1. mm. Nevertheless, populations of these structures typically encompass a wide size range and in some cases they form the small-size fraction of fracture arrays that include much larger factures. In geologic settings, microfractures commonly form as Mode I (opening) fractures where the minimum principal stress exceeds the elastic tensile strength creating a narrow opening displacement; in isotropic rocks such fractures mark the plane perpendicular to the least compressive principal stress during fracture growth. These planar or curviplanar openings provide an opportunity for fluids and/or gases to enter the created cavity. Cement deposits or crack closure may trap fluids or gases, leaving mineral precipitates and a track of enclosed fluids and gases. In transmitted light these precipitates frequently manifest as fluid-inclusion planes (FIPs). Cathodoluminescence (CL) images show that many are cement-filled microveins. Microfractures can be used to assess the paleostress history or fluid movement history of a rock body. Also, because sudden opening produces acoustic emissions, microfractures created in the laboratory can be used to assess the rock-failure process. Here we review recent discoveries made using microfractures, including fracture patterns, strain, fracture growth and size-scaling, evolution of stresses around propagating faults (process zones), far-field tectonic stresses, and insights into the state of stress leading to earthquakes.},

To address this problem, it is desirable to collect, for a singlematerial, measurements obtained by different methods and pore fluids.

To complement the data set of permeability measurements presented in a companion paper, we focus here on (i) quantitative analysis of microstructures and pore size distribution, (ii) permeability modelling and (iii) complementary measurements of permeability anisotropy and poroelastic parameters. Broad ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, micro-computerized tomography, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods were used to characterize the microstructures and provided the input parameters for permeability modelling. Several models were used: (i) basic statistical models, (ii) 3-D pore network and effective medium models, (iii) percolation model using MICP data and (iv) free-fluid model using NMR data. The models were generally successful in predicting the actual range of measured permeability. Statistical models overestimate the permeability because they do not adequately account for the heterogeneity of the crack network. Pore network and effective medium models provide additional constraints on crack parameters such as aspect ratio, aperture, density and connectivity.MICP and advanced microscopy techniques are very useful tools providing important input data for permeability estimation.

Methods of measurement as well as experimental devices, designed by our laboratory, are presented and commented on. Permeability values, measured on six different samples, either with gas or ethanol, clearly show that the results obtained with the two fluids are virtually identical as soon as the gas measurements are corrected for the Klinkenberg effect. As the permeability is not very sensitive to confining pressure variation, it can be assumed that the intact rock is slightly cracked. This is confirmed with microscopic observations as well as poro-elastic property measurements. Concerning the latter, various ways of obtaining their values are presented and compared. They include drained and undrained bulk modulus, Biot and Skempton coefficients and Biot modulus; the consistency between these parameters is finally highlighted and demonstrates that the classical theory of poro-elasticity hold very well for such a rock, which is almost monomineralic with quite a high porosity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we use an implementation of Amadei's (1983) solution of the stress field around the borehole in an anisotropic formation to study the Skempton-induced pore pressure.

Discarding some outliers from the bulk data set (4 out of 39) an average permeability of 1.11 × 10-18 m2 with a standard deviation of 0.57 × 10-18 m2 was obtained. The most striking result was the large difference in permeability for gas measurements compared to liquid measurements. Regardless of the method used, gas permeability was higher than liquid permeability by a factor approximately 2 (kgas = 1.28 × 10-18 m2 compared to kliquid = 0.65 × 10-18 m2). Possible explanations are that (i) liquid permeability was underestimated due to fluid-rock interactions (ii) gas permeability was overestimated due to insufficient correction for gas slippage and/or (iii) gases and liquids do not probe exactly the same porous networks. The analysis of Knudsen numbers shows that the gas permeability measurementswere performed in conditions forwhich theKlinkenberg correction is sufficient. Smaller samples had a larger scatter of permeability values, suggesting that their volume were below the Representative Elementary Volume. The pressure dependence of permeability was studied by some of the participating teams in the range 1-30 MPa and could be fitted to an exponential law k = ko.exp(-$\gamma$ Peff) with $\gamma$ = 0.093 MPa-1.

abstract = {Recent, detailed examinations of fault zones show that walls of faults are often bordered by materials that are different from each other and from the more uniform material farther away. In addition, they show that the ultracataclastic core of mature fault zones, where slip is concentrated, is less permeable to flow across it than the adjoining material of the damage zone. Inhomogeneous slip at the interface between materials with different poroelastic properties and permeabilities causes a change in pore pressure there. Because slip causes compression on one side of the fault wall and extension on the other, the pore pressure on the fault increases substantially when the compressed side is significantly more permeable and decreases when, instead, the extended side is more permeable. This change in pore pressure alters the effective normal stress on the slip plane in a way that is analogous to the normal stress alteration in sliding between elastically dissimilar solids. The magnitude of the effect due to induced pore pressure can be comparable to or larger than that induced by sliding between elastic solids with a dissimilarity of properties consistent with seismic observations. The induced pore pressure effect is increased by increasing contrast in permeability, but the normal stress alteration due to elastic contrast increases rapidly as the rupture velocity approaches the generalized Rayleigh velocity. Because the alteration in effective normal stress due to either effect can be positive or negative, depending on the contrast in properties, the two effects can augment or offset each other. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The unjacketed bulk modulus is a convenient choice because it can be directly measured in a laboratory test under a loading that preserves the difference between the mean stress and the pore pressure constant. For a monomineralic rock, the measurement of the unjacketed bulk modulus is ignored because it is assumed to be equal to the bulk modulus of the solid phase. To examine this assumption, we tested porous sandstones and limestones mainly composed of quartz and calcite, respectively, under the unjacketed condition. Special attention was dedicated to reaching full saturation ensuring the transmission of the pore pressure to the solid frame. The presence of microscale inhomogeneities, in the form of nonconnected (occluded) pores, was shown to cause a considerable difference between the unjacketed bulk modulus and the bulk modulus of the solid phase. Furthermore, we found the unjacketed bulk modulus to be independent of the unjacketed pressure and Terzaghi effective pressure and therefore a constant.},

The transducers measure the differential pressure between the confining fluid and the internal pore pressure. The design is easily adaptable to tune the sensitivity and working pressure range up to several hundred megapascals. An array of four such transducers was tested during hydrostatic pressurization cycles on Darley Dale sandstone and Westerly granite. The prototypes show very good linearity up to 80 MPa with maximum deviations of the order of 0.25 MPa, regardless of the combination of pore and confining pressure. Multiple internal pore pressure measurements allow us to quantify the local decrease in permeability associated with faulting in Darley Dale sandstone, and also prove useful in tracking the development of pore pressure fronts during transient flow in low permeability Westerly granite.},

abstract = {Biot and Willis (1957) performed micromechanical analysis on isotropic poroelastic materials and presented three material constants, the jacketed compressibility, the unjacketed compressibility, and the coefficient of fluid content, to characterize the volumetric deformation. Brown and Korringa (1975) and Rice and Cleary (1976) recast them into a drained bulk modulus K, an unjacketed bulk modulus Ks′, and an unjacketed pore modulus Ks′′. The constant Ks′′ is tied to the storage capacity of porous medium; hence is highly important in petroleum and geosequestration applications. It is, however, difficult to measure in the laboratory due to the lack of a direct way to observe pore volume deformation. In this work, a physics based approach is used to explore these micromechanical constants. Three intrinsic material constants that isolate the physical mechanisms, an unjacketed solid bulk modulus Ks, a drained pore modulus Kp, and a micro inhomogeneity and anisotropy modulus K$\psi$, are presented to characterize the porous material. Bounds on material constants are developed based on thermodynamics and elastic stability requirements. Past attempts in measuring Ks′′ using direct or indirect approaches are compiled. Most of the efforts failed to satisfy the theoretical bounds. Only those attempted to measure the change in pore volume passed the test. The intrinsic constants are used to interpret the bulk material constants, such as the drained and undrained bulk modulus, and the storage and Skempton pore pressure coefficient. The total volume change and the storage capacity can be partitioned into those attributed to solid, pore, fluid, and the microinhomogeneity compressibilities. A published data set on stress dependent Skempton pore pressure coefficient and bulk modulus is reanalyzed. The data are matched by the calibration of a single of K$\psi$ value.},

abstract = {Many recent studies of stress-triggered seismicity rely on a fault failure model with a single free parameter, the apparent coefficient of friction, presumed to be a material constant with possible values 0 ≤ $\mu$′ ≤ 1. These studies may present a misleading view of fault strength and the role of pore fluid pressure in earthquake failure. The parameter $\mu$′ is intended to incorporate the effects of both friction and pore pressure, but is a material constant only if changes in pore fluid pressure induced by changes in stress are proportional to the normal stress change across the potential failure plane. Although specific models of fault zones permit such a relation, neither is it known that fault zones within the Earth behave this way, nor is this behavior expected in all cases. In contrast, for an isotropic homogeneous poroelastic model the pore pressure changes are proportional to changes in mean stress, $\mu$′ is not a material constant, and -∞ ≤ $\mu$′ ≤ +∞. Analysis of the change in Coulomb failure stress for tectonically loaded reverse and strike-slip faults shows considerable differences between these two pore pressure models, suggesting that such models might be distinguished from one another using observations of triggered seismicity (e.g., aftershocks). We conclude that using the constant apparent friction model exclusively in studies of Coulomb failure stress is unwise and could lead to significant errors in estimated stress change and seismic hazard.},

abstract = {Fluid infiltration and pore fluid pressure changes are known to have a significant effect on the occurrence of earthquakes. Yet, for most damaging earthquakes, with nucleation zones below a few kilometers depth, direct measurements of fluid pressure variations are not available. Instead, pore fluid pressures are inferred primarily from seismic-wave propagation characteristics such as Vp/Vs ratio, attenuation, and reflectivity contacts. We present laboratory measurements of changes in P-wave velocity and attenuation during the injection of water into a granite sample as it was loaded to failure. A cylindrical sample of Westerly granite was deformed at constant confining and pore pressures of 50 and 1 MPa, respectively. Axial load was increased in discrete steps by controlling axial displacement. Anisotropic P-wave velocity and attenuation fields were determined during the experiment using an array of 13 piezoelectric transducers. At the final loading steps (86% and 95% of peak stress), both spatial and temporal changes in P-wave velocity and peak-to-peak amplitudes of P and S waves were observed. P-wave velocity anisotropy reached a maximum of 26%. Transient increases in attenuation of up to 483 dB/m were also observed and were associated with diffusion of water into the sample. We show that velocity and attenuation of P waves are sensitive to the process of opening of microcracks and the subsequent resaturation of these cracks as water diffuses in from the surrounding region. Symmetry of the orientation of newly formed microcracks results in anisotropic velocity and attenuation fields that systematically evolve in response to changes in stress and influx of water. With proper scaling, these measurements provide constraints on the magnitude and duration of velocity and attenuation transients that can be expected to accompany the nucleation of earthquakes in the Earth's crust.},

abstract = {Pore pressure changes are rigorously included in Coulomb stress calculations for fault interaction studies. These are considered changes under undrained conditions for analyzing very short term postseismic response. The assumption that pore pressure is proportional to fault-normal stress leads to the widely used concept of an effective friction coefficient. We provide an exact expression for undrained fault zone pore pressure changes to evaluate the validity of that concept. A narrow fault zone is considered whose poroelastic parameters are different from those in the surrounding medium, which is assumed to be elastically isotropic. We use conditions for mechanical equilibrium of stress and geometric compatibility of strain to express the effective normal stress change within the fault as a weighted linear combination of mean stress and fault-normal stress changes in the surroundings. Pore pressure changes are determined by fault-normal stress changes when the shear modulus within the fault zone is significantly smaller than in the surroundings but by mean stress changes when the elastic mismatch is small. We also consider an anisotropic fault zone, introducing a Skempton tensor for pore pressure changes. If the anisotropy is extreme, such that fluid pressurization under constant stress would cause expansion only in the fault-normal direction, then the effective friction coefficient concept applies exactly. We finally consider moderately longer timescales than those for undrained response. A sufficiently permeable fault may come to local pressure equilibrium with its surroundings even while that surrounding region may still be undrained, leading to pore pressure change determined by mean stress changes in those surroundings.},

abstract = {Crack damage results in a decrease of elastic wave velocities and in the development of anisotropy. Using non-interactive crack effective medium theory as a fundamental tool, we calculate dry and wet elastic properties of cracked rocks in terms of a crack density tensor, average crack aspect ratio and mean crack fabric orientation from the solid grains and fluid elastic properties. Using this same tool, we show that both the anisotropy and shear-wave splitting of elastic waves can be derived. Two simple crack distributions are considered for which the predicted anisotropy depends strongly on the saturation, reaching up to 60% in the dry case. Comparison with experimental data on two granites, a basalt and a marble, shows that the range of validity of the non-interactive effective medium theory model extends to a total crack density of approximately 0.5, considering symmetries up to orthorhombic. In the isotropic case, Kachanov's (1994) non-interactive effective medium model was used in order to invert elastic wave velocities and infer both crack density and aspect ratio evolutions. Inversions are stable and give coherent results in terms of crack density and aperture evolution. Crack density variations can be interpreted in terms of crack growth and/or changes of the crack surface contact areas as cracks are being closed or opened respectively. More importantly, the recovered evolution of aspect ratio shows an exponentially decreasing aspect ratio (and therefore aperture) with pressure, which has broader geophysical implications, in particular on fluid flow. The recovered evolution of aspect ratio is also consistent with current mechanical theories of crack closure. In the anisotropic cases-both transverse isotropic and orthorhombic symmetries were considered-anisotropy and saturation patterns were well reproduced by the modelling, and mean crack fabric orientations we recovered are consistent with in situ geophysical imaging. Our results point out that: (1) It is possible to predict damage, anisotropy and saturation in terms of a crack density tensor and mean crack aspect ratio and orientation; (2) using well constrained wave velocity data, it is possible to extrapolate the contemporaneous evolution of crack density, anisotropy and saturation using wave velocity inversion as a tool; 3) using such an inversion tool opens the door in linking elastic properties, variations to permeability. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, Basel, 2006.},

abstract = {In upper crustal conditions, where effective pressure is not high enough to close them, all rocks contain cracks. Understanding the effect of cracks on both the elastic anisotropy and the elastic waves frequency dependence (dispersion) is of major interest to Underground Storage Monitoring, Reservoir Monitoring, and Fault Mechanics. The challenge is to extract from geophysical data the maximum information with a minimal number of assumptions and model parameters. This is possible if reference data exist at the laboratory scale and if extrapolation from laboratory to field scale is not biased. In order to check that, investigating few basic idealized cases can provide useful guidelines. Let us consider an isotropic rock matrix and assume that dispersion is the result of squirt-flow. In this paper we will not consider crack-to-pore but rather focus on crack-to-crack squirt-flow. Three basic cracks configurations are quantitatively investigated, for which the elastic symmetry is transverse isotropy (TI). Our aim is to check if - from first principles - high frequency laboratory data can be used for field data interpretation in these three cases. The first case is that of identical cracks aligned in the same direction. A sufficiently strong deviatoric stress field in a given plane is expected to induce such a distribution at the field scale ($\sigma$1=$\sigma$2≫$\sigma$3). We show that it results in a maximum anisotropy but with virtually no dispersion. Because there is no dispersion, high frequency data obtained in the laboratory (MHz ultrasonic range) are directly applicable to field data (Hz to kHz range) interpretation. Thomsen parameters provide then a direct proxy for crack density. A second case is that of identical cracks with random orientations (isotropic distribution). Such a situation could exist at the field scale if cracks result from the superposition of several independent tectonic episodes associated with different directions of principal stresses. In that case $\sigma$1=$\sigma$2=$\sigma$3. This configuration could also result from thermal cracking in an initially isotropic metamorphic rock. Obviously, there is no overall anisotropy then, but we show that dispersion may be large. Due to dispersion, ultrasonic laboratory data are not directly applicable to field data interpretation (unless the medium is dry). A third, intermediate case, is that of cracks randomly distributed in zone with a given axis. The corresponding symmetry is that of a so-called axi-symmetric triaxial test (which in fact is biaxial). It is of interest because it represents a classical laboratory experiment situation. It can also exist at the field scale if one principal stress is much larger than both others ($\sigma$1=$\sigma$2<<$\sigma$3). This case provides a simple example where both anisotropy and dispersion exist. Extrapolation of laboratory data to field scale is therefore not straightforward. Some quantitative microstructural information can however be derived from anisotropy quantification. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We experimentally assess the impact of microstructure, pore fluid, and frequency on wave velocity, wave dispersion, and permeability in thermally cracked Carrara marble under effective pressure up to 50 MPa. The cracked rock is isotropic, and we observe that (1) P and S wave velocities at 500 kHz and the low-strain (<10−5) mechanical moduli at 0.01 Hz are pressure-dependent, (2) permeability decreases asymptotically toward a small value with increasing pressure, (3) wave dispersion between 0.01 Hz and 500 MHz in the water-saturated rock reaches a maximum of $\sim$26% for S waves and $\sim$9% for P waves at 1 MPa, and (4) wave dispersion virtually vanishes above $\sim$30 MPa. Assuming no interactions between the cracks, effective medium theory is used to model the rock's elastic response and its permeability. P and S wave velocity data are jointly inverted to recover the crack density and effective aspect ratio. The permeability data are inverted to recover the cracks' effective radius. These parameters lead to a good agreement between predicted and measured wave velocities, dispersion and permeability up to 50 MPa, and up to a crack density of $\sim$0.5. The evolution of the crack parameters suggests that three deformation regimes exist: (1) contact between cracks' surface asperities up to $\sim$10 MPa, (2) progressive crack closure between $\sim$10 and 30 MPa, and (3) crack closure effectively complete above $\sim$30 MPa. The derived crack parameters differ significantly from those obtained by analysis of 2-D electron microscope images of thin sections or 3-D X-ray microtomographic images of millimeter-size specimens.},

Guided by microstructural observations we adopted a two-parameter axisymmetric distribution to characterize the crack density, which predicts that in a fluid-saturated rock the parameters $\delta$ and $\gamma$ are related to $\epsilon$ in a nonlinear manner. All three parameters considered are sensitively dependent on the difference in the densities of cracks with normals parallel and perpendicular to the symmetry axis. Theoretical predictions of the model are compared with laboratory and field measurements of seismic anisotropy. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2007.},

abstract = {The ultrasonic transmission method was used to measure P-, SH-, and SV-wave velocities for Chelmsford granite, Chicopee shale, and Berea sandstone in different directions up to 1000 bars confining pressure. The velocity measurements indicate these 3 rocks are elastically anisotropic. The stiffness constants, dynamic Young's moduli, dynamic Poission's ratios, and dynamic bulk moduli of the 3 rocks were also calculated. The elastic constants, together with velocity measurements, suggest that: 1) elastic anisotropy is due to the combined effect of pores or cracks and mineral grain orientation; and 2) elastic anisotropy decreases with increasing confining pressure. The residual anisotropy at higher confining pressure is due to mineral grain orientation.-Authors},

abstract = {Uniaxial compression tests on rocks, if conducted at stresses below failure, typically exhibit both non-linearity and hysteresis in the stress-strain curve. In a series of three papers in 1965, Walsh explained this behavior in terms of frictional sliding along the faces of closed cracks. Although well known and widely cited, Walsh's model does not seem to have previously been developed in sufficient detail to be used for quantitative predictions. We revisit and extend his model, by including the effect of the stress required to close an initially open crack, and by examining the unloading process in detail. Our analysis leads to closed-form expressions for the loading and unloading portions of the stress-strain curve, as functions of elastic modulus of the uncracked rock, the crack density, the characteristic aspect ratio, and the crack friction coefficient. The model provides a good fit to the loading and unloading portions of the stress-strain curves, for some data on Berea sandstone taken from the literature, and for some new experimental data acquired on thermally cracked La Peyratte granite. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When Palisades diabase and Westerly granite are made dilatant by cyclic differential stress not exceeding approx 85% of fracture strength, they behave as nonelastic, energy-absorbing media. However, in some ways, their properties show reversibility more typical of elastic media. The quasi-elastic behavior is characterized by the property 'memory'. Memory in dilatant rock is manifested by the closure of material property hysteresis loops when the sample is returned to certain previous differential stress states. Simple examples of memory have been observed before in Westerly granite. The present work confirms the existence of memory for strain and compressional wave velocity in Westerly granite and Palisades diabase at confining pressures between 250 and 1500 bars. Memory of maxima or minima of the stress difference can be developed, with multiple points remembered simultaneously. A theory of memory based on reversible tensile Griffith cracks was developed which predicts a variety of phenomena, many of which have been observed. -Author},

Here a rock specimen of Westerly granite was submitted to differential stress cycles (i.e., loading and unloading) of increasing amplitudes, up to failure and under upper crustal conditions. Combined records of strains, acoustic emissions, and P and S elastic wave anisotropies demonstrate that increasing differential stress promotes crack opening, sliding, and propagation subparallel to the main compressive stress orientation. However, the significant elastic anisotropies observed during loading (≥20%) almost vanish upon stress removal, demonstrating that in the absence of stress, crack-related elastic anisotropy remains limited (≤10%). As a consequence, (i) crack-related elastic anisotropies measured in the crust will likely be a strong function of the level of differential stress, and consequently (ii) continuous monitoring of elastic wave velocity anisotropy along faults could shed light on the mechanism of stress accumulation during interseismic loading.},

abstract = {We measured Vp/Vs ratios of thermally cracked Westerly granite, thermally cracked Carrara marble and 4% porosity Fontainebleau sandstone, for an effective mean pressure ranging from 2 to 95 MPa. Samples were fluid-saturated alternatively with argon gas and water (5 MPa constant pore pressure). The experimental results show that at ultrasonic frequencies, Vp/Vs ratio of water saturated specimen never exceeded 2.15, even at effective mean pressure as low as 2 MPa, or for a lithology for which the Poisson's ratio of minerals is as high as 0.3 (calcite). In order to check these results against theoretical models: we examine first a randomly oriented cracked medium (with dispersion but without anisotropy); and second a medium with horizontally aligned cracks (with anisotropy but without dispersion). The numerical results show that experimental data agree well with the first model: at high frequency, Vp/Vs ratios range from 1.6 to 1.8 in the dry case and from 1.6 to 2.2 in the saturated case. The second model predicts both Vp/Sv and Vp/Sh to vary from 1.2 to 3.5, depending on the raypath angle relative to the crack fabric. In addition, perpendicular to the crack fabric, a high Vp/Vs ratio is predicted in the absence of shear wave splitting. From these results, we argue the possibility that high Vp/Vs ratio (>2.2) as recently imaged by seismic tomography in subduction zones, may come from zones presenting important crack anisotropy. The cumulative effects of crack anisotropy and high pore fluid pressure are required to get Vp/Vs ratios above 2.2. {\textcopyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Using effective elasticity, we derive Thomsen's parameters for the case of dry and fluid-saturated cracks, in a rock of isotropic background, in terms of crack density parameters and fluid compressibility. These results can be of interest for the interpretation of seismological and seismic data. They provide moreover a way to identify the fluid nature (gas or liquid) and to extract the crack density tensor from elastic wave data. Frequency effects are discussed when fluid is present so that frequency dependence can be accounted for. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An effective medium approach (differential self-consistent scheme) has been used to calculate elastic wave velocities in rocks containing spherical pores and ellipsoidal cracks with two fluid phases. The results are applied to the case of imbibition/drainage processes performed in the laboratory (at high frequencies). For that purpose, two scales of heterogeneities are accounted for. The first one corresponds to the size of pores or cracks. It is the scale of a dispersion mechanism termed "local flow" because it depends on local variations in pore/crack compressibility. The second scale, much larger, is controlled by the size of the heterogeneities of the fluid phase distribution. These heterogeneities are assimilated to pockets whose saturation is different from that of the surrounding medium. The pocket scale involves a second dispersion mechanism, often called "global flow" or "pocket flow," which depends on fluid pressure equilibration among the regions which have distinct saturation levels. Our calculations include both mechanisms, each having its own characteristic scale. Imbibition is described through simple relations involving two parameters. The same is true for drainage. The predicted behavior for P wave velocities against saturation appears to be in good agreement with experimental data reported in the literature, for both drainage and imbibition.},

abstract = {Although P- and S-wave dispersion is known to be important in porous/cracked rocks, theoretical predictions of such dispersions have never been given. We report such calculations and show that the predicted dispersions are high in the case of low aspect ratio cracks (≤10-3) or high crack density (≥10-1). Our calculations are derived from first-principle computations of the high- and low-frequency elastic moduli of a rock permeated by an isotropic distribution of pores or cracks, dry or saturated, with idealized geometry (spheres or ellipsoids). Henyey and Pomphrey developed a differential self-consistent model that is shown to be a good approximation. This model is used here, but as it considers cracks with zero thickness, it can not account for fluid content effects. To remove this difficulty, we combine the differential self-consistent approach with a purely elastic calculation of moduli in two cases: that of spherical pores and that of oblate spheroidal cracks with a nonzero volume. This leads to what we call the "extended differential, self-consistent model" (EM). When combining these EM results with the Gassmann equation, it is possible to derive and compare the theoretical predictions for high- and low-frequency effective moduli in the case of a saturated rock. Since most laboratory data are ultrasonic measurements and in situ data are obtained at much lower frequencies, this comparison is useful for interpreting seismic data in terms of rock and fluid properties. The predicted dispersions are high, in agreement with previous experimental results. A second comparison is made with the semi-empirical model of Marion and Nur, which considers the effects of a mixed porosity (round pores and cracks together).},

abstract = {In the past decade the number of studies about microcracks in rocks has rapidly increased. This review of recent work concentrates on microcracks in rock as separate entities, emphasizing microcrack morphogenesis, kinematics, dynamics, population statistics and observational techniques. Cracks are produced when the local stress exceeds the local strength. The local stress may be augmented by twin lamellae interactions, kink bands and deformation lamellae, stress concentrations at grain boundary contacts and around intracrystalline cavities. Local strength may be reduced along cleavage planes, along grain boundaries and along any internal surface as a result of corrosion by chemically active fluids. Dislocations appear not to be a significant factor for crack nucleation below about 500°C in silicates. Spatial and temporal changes in temperature can also induce microcracking as a result of differential thermal expansion between grains with different thermoelastic moduli and thermal conductivities. The amount of quartz in the rock has a significant effect on thermally induced microcracks because of its large and variable thermal expansivity. The application of hydrostatic pressure between 100 and 200 MPa effectively closes most cracks, but the closure may not be uniform if crack wall asperities exist. Hydrostatic pressure appears to stabilize cracks and make crack growth more difficult. The number and average size of mechanically induced microcracks is greater in rock deformed at higher pressures. The application of a deviatoric stress field on the boundaries of a rock mass results, on a microscopic scale, in a very complex stress system which greatly affects nucleation and propagation paths. The relative amount of intragranular and intergranular cracking appears to depend upon mineralogy, rock type and stress state. The vast majority of stress-induced microcracks in rocks appear to be extensional. Statistically, they are predominantly oriented within 30° of the macroscopic maximum stress direction. Crack densities increase as macroscopic deviatoric stress increases above a threshold level. Crack size distributions may be either lognormal or exponential. Fracture in rock under compressive boundary loads is a result of the coalescence of many microcracks, not the growth of a single crack. Some crack configurations are more favorable for coalescence than others. As deviatoric stress increases and rock failure is approached, the microcrack population changes spatially from random to locally intense zones of cracking. Away from the fault, the crack density dies off rapidly to the background level a few grains away. Under lesser deviatoric stresses, slow, subcritical microcrack growth can occur as a result of stress-aided corrosion at the crack tip. The rate governing mechanism may be either the chemical reaction rate or the rate at which water can get to the crack tip. Important details still remain to be worked out. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

In contrast, Vs is unaffected by the presence of fluid; low velocity persists at low pressure. The shape of the pores in typical crystalline rocks plays an important role: increase in Vp due to saturation of pores occurs when the pores are in the form of cracks but not when they are in the form of round holes.

abstract = {Using pulse methods recently developed, direct measurements of the dilatational and rotational elastic wave velocities in igneous rocks were made. D. C. pulses, impressed on 5 MC X-cut piezoelectric quartz crystals, were used to excite sharp, elastic pulses in rocks. The amplified output of similar detector crystals was studied and photographed using suitable oscilloscopes. Two main arrivals of energy were precisely timed, and from the travel times the dilatational and elastic velocities were computed. Velocities were measured with an accuracy greater than 1 per cent. Regarding rocks as homogeneous, isotropic media, the elastic constants were computed from the velocity data. The sample assembly was placed in a pressure cell, surrounded by an oil bath; thus measurements at high pressures and temperatures could readily be made. Measurements were made in the pressure range 1-1100 kg./cm.2 and the temperature range 30-150°C. Samples of granite, quartz monzonite, diorite, andesite, and norite were investigated. Materials were studied both while enclosed in impervious copper jackets and while exposed to the fluid pressure medium. The enclosed samples had relatively great increases of velocity with pressure at the low pressures, presumably due to closing of initial pore space; the rate of increase became small and essentially linear at higher confining pressures. Open samples had small, linear rates of increase of velocity over the entire pressure range. Pressure increase was accompanied by increase of wave velocities and elastic constants in all cases. Increase of temperature was accompanied by decrease in velocities and moduli. Changes of Poisson's ratio with pressure and temperature were small and erratic. The reasonably good agreement of the present work at effective frequencies of 2-6 megacycles with earlier measurements at low frequencies suggests that for rocks the effect of frequency upon velocity is negligible, although the data are, as yet, inconclusive. The present work has established a useful method of obtaining direct measurements of elastic wave velocities in rocks. Extension of the pressure and temperature ranges should provide data valuable for comparison with earthquake seismic results for the earth's crust. {\textcopyright} 1950, The Geological Society of America, Inc.},

In our experiments with water, it was about 10-7 sec-1 for cylindrical samples of granite several centimeters long for example. In experiments at loading rates greater than the critical value, the rock was as much as 50 per cent stronger than at zero pore pressure.

Five rock types were studied; Clashach, Bentheim and Darley Dale sandstones (all quartz-rich) and a Seljadur basalt and Portland limestone (both quartz-free), both air dry and the rocks were tested in distilled water. Shallow crustal conditions were simulated in a triaxial rock deformation cell with a confining pressure simulating depth of 40 MPa, pore pressures ranging 5-35 MPa, and strain rates 10-7 -10-4 s-1. Precursory electric potential signals prior to failure were observed in both saturated and dry samples of the quartz-rich sandstones, but only observed in the water saturated quartz-free rocks. Co-seismic electrical signals were obtained in all tests, providing strong evidence that two of the main sources for precursory and co-seismic signals are the piezoelectric and electrokinetic phenomena. Lowering the strain rate resulted in an increase in the number of acoustic emissions. The pore volume changes during compaction and dilatancy remained approximately constant for all strain rates. Streaming potential generated by fluid flow across the sample was also measured at different stages of deformation. The potential signals increased with the pore pressure gradient. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dilatancy during rock failure is a key process promoting fluid flow in the crust. Since rock failure is linked to spatio-temporal localisation of deformation, dilatancy is expected to be strongly localised around the fault plane, and to lead to dramatic local reductions in fluid pressure during rupture, potentially impacting dynamic weakening processes such as thermal pressurisation. The existence of coseismic fluid pressure drops have been inferred from field studies, notably in gold deposits which are thought to be formed by this process, but reliable quantitative predictions are still lacking. Here, experimental results are presented where local on- and off-fault fluid pressure variations were measured in situ during dynamic rock fracture and frictional slip under upper crustal stress conditions. During the main rupture, the on-fault fluid pressure dropped rapidly to zero, indicating partial vaporisation and/or degassing. Further deformation produced stick-slip events systematically associated with near-instantaneous drops in fluid pressure, providing direct experimental support of the concept of "seismic suction pump". Extrapolation of the laboratory results indicate that dilatancy-induced fluid pressure drops might be a widespread phenomenon in the crust, counteracting thermal pressurisation as a weakening mechanisms in freshly fractured rock.},

The equation for 〈P〉 was first suggested by Geertsma (1957) and by Skempton (1960) on empirical grounds. The expression does not depend directly on porosity, but when pores vanish the effective pressure 〈P〉 equals the confining pressure Pc, because then K=Ks. Thus the strain of a porous solid with pore pressure can be completely determined from the elastic modulus of the solid without pore pressure, if the effective stress law in the equation for 〈$\sigma$ij〉 is used. The exact expression for the effective stress describes quite accurately the measured strains in sandstone and granite samples at confining and pore pressures to 2.5 kb. The results are not applicable to inelastic processes, such as fracture, or elastic processes other than strain.},

abstract = {Upper crustal rocks contain cracks of diverse sizes, shapes and orientations. Predicting their influence on the effective elastic properties of a rock poses a challenging problem of considerable interest, in particular to seismologists. In geophysics, theoretical work on this problem is usually complicated by the presence of pore fluids or when the defect-free matrix of a rock is elastically anisotropic, as in the case of shales for example. The first challenge arising in this context is the identification of microstructure-sentive parameters in terms of which the effective elastic constants are to be expressed. Simple parameters such as volume fraction or crack density (as usually defined) may not suffice for capturing the way in which the complex microstructure of a rock determines its effective elasticity. Defect interactions present another challenge and a number of approximate theoretical schemes have been designed to deal with this problem, but their applicability is not always clear. This chapter offers a critical assessment of these questions, putting the emphasis on microcracks as microstructural elements that often have a dominant effect on the overall elasticity. The issues of matrix anisotropy and frequency effects are examined. Because elastic wave velocities carry microstructural information, it is possible and of great interest to extract from them information on pore and crack content, as well as on the presence and properties of pore fluids. Problems related to multiple defects have been discussed in a broader context of mechanics of materials for over half a century. One of the goals of the present work is to bridge a gap in this area between geophysics and the general mechanics of materials. The former does not always utilize the results of the latter; the latter often neglects specific complexities of the former.},

abstract = {The constitutive equations of linear poroelastioity presented by Biot (1955) and Biot and Willis (1957) extended the description of rock behavior into the realm of saturated porous rocks. For isotropic material behavior, Rice and Cleary (1976) gave a formulation which involved material constants whose physical interpretation was particularly simple and direct; this is an aid both to their measurement and to the interpretation of predictions from the theory. This paper treats anisotropic poroelasticity in terms of material tensors with interpretations similar to those of the constants employed by Rice and Cleary. An effective stress principle is derived for such anisotropic material. The material tensors are defined, rigorously, from the stress field and pore fluid content changes produced by boundary displacements compatible with a uniform mean strain and uniform pore pressure increments. Such displacements and pore pressure increments lead to homogeneous deformation on all scales significantly larger than the length scale of microstructural inhomogeneities. This macroscopic behavior is related to the microscopic behavior of the solid skeleton. The tensors which describe the microscopic behavior of the solid skeleton would be difficult, even impossible, to measure, but their introduction allows relationships between measurable quantities to be identified. The end product of the analysis is a set of constitutive equations in which the parameters are all measurable directly from well-accepted testing procedures. Relationships exist between measurable quantities that can be used to verify that the constitutive equations described here are valid for the rock under consideration. The case of transverse isotropy is discussed explicitly for illustration. {\textcopyright} 1991 by ASME.},

abstract = {Effects of thermal crack damage on the rupture processes of a fine-grained granite were investigated under triaxial stress, under water (wet) and argon gas (dry) saturated conditions, and at room temperature. Thermal cracking was introduced by slowly heating and cooling two samples of La Peyratte granite up to 700°C, which were compared to two intact specimens. For each rock sample, a hydrostatic test was first carried up to 90 MPa effective pressure (5 MPa constant pore pressure). The samples were then deformed to failure at a constant strain rate of 2.10-6s-1, at 30 MPa effective pressure. Our results show that (1) permeability of heat-treated specimens was 4-5 orders of magnitude larger than that of intact specimens at low effective mean pressure; (2) nevertheless, at our experimental conditions (2.10-6 s-1), thermal cracking had no significant influence on the brittle strength; (3) similarly, no obvious water weakening effect was observed; (4) however, with increasing stress, elastic anisotropy appeared at lower differential stress in heat-treated specimens than in intact ones, but close to failure, the magnitude of P wave anisotropy was approximately the same for both types of specimens; (5) acoustic emission hypocenter locations and P wave velocity anisotropy in the basal plane demonstrate that strain localization started right at the onset of dilatancy for heat-treated specimens, later in the intact specimens; and (6) inverting wave velocities for crack density, we show that failure was reached for vertical crack densities of 0.35 for dry specimens and possibly 0.5 for water-saturated specimens. {\textcopyright}2013.

abstract = {In the upper crust, where brittle deformation mechanisms dominate, the development of crack networks subject to anisotropic stress fields generates stress-induced elastic anisotropy. Here a rock specimen of Westerly granite was submitted to differential stress cycles (i.e., loading and unloading) of increasing amplitudes, up to failure and under upper crustal conditions. Combined records of strains, acoustic emissions, and P and S elastic wave anisotropies demonstrate that increasing differential stress promotes crack opening, sliding, and propagation subparallel to the main compressive stress orientation. However, the significant elastic anisotropies observed during loading (≥20%) almost vanish upon stress removal, demonstrating that in the absence of stress, crack-related elastic anisotropy remains limited (≤10%). As a consequence, (i) crack-related elastic anisotropies measured in the crust will likely be a strong function of the level of differential stress, and consequently (ii) continuous monitoring of elastic wave velocity anisotropy along faults could shed light on the mechanism of stress accumulation during interseismic loading.},

abstract = {Gassmann's original equation provides a means to relate bulk elastic parameters of a porous material with the compressibility of the pore fluid. The original analysis assumed microhomogeneity and isotropy, which assumed that pore compressibility was equal to grain compressibility. Although subsequent theoretical arguments have shown that Gassmann's original assumption is violated for most rocks and that pore compressibility need not equal grain compressibility, few experimental studies have compared the two compressibilities; the assumption that pore compressibility equals grain compressibility is still commonly made. We measured hydrostatic poroelastic constants of Berea sandstone and Indiana limestone under drained, undrained, and unjacketed conditions over a range of confining and pore pressures to test the assumption that pore compressibility equals grain compressibility. These two rocks were chosen because they havesimilar values of porosity but different elastic behaviors: Berea sandstone is nonlinearly elastic, especially at low effective stresses, but Indiana limestone is linearly elastic at nearly all stresses. At low effective stresses below MPa, the pore compressibility for Berea sandstone does not equal grain compressibility but approaches fluid compressibility. Even at higher effective stresses, pore compressibility for Berea sandstone does not equal bulk grain compressibility but approaches a value approximately two to three times the bulk grain compressibility. In contrast, pore compressibility for Indiana limestone does seem to be equal to grain compressibility except perhaps at low effective stresses below MPa. The difference between pore compressibilities of these two rocks is likely from the presence of more compliant clay minerals mixed with quartz grains with more microcracks in the Berea sandstone as compared to the well-cemented Indiana limestone. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental work aimed at assessing the correlation between fracture toughness (KIC) and fracture roughness for a series of Westerly granite specimens thermally treated up to 850°C. Mode I fracture toughness as a function of thermal treatment is determined using Cracked Chevron Notched Brazilian Disc specimens. The degree of roughness of the resultant fracture surfaces is analyzed with the aid of a high accuracy, high precision stereo-topometric measurement system. Roughness and toughness values display a negative correlation as a function of temperature. Fracture toughness decreases with increasing temperature due to the gradual opening of grain-grain boundaries in response to thermal stresses. Mode I fractures preferentially follow these weakened grain-grain boundaries, which in addition to the thermal expansion of individual grains, result in rougher failure profiles with increasing temperature. At low temperature, a distinct anisotropy in roughness was observed in all fracture surfaces with higher roughness values perpendicular to the direction of fracture propagation. However, higher treatment temperatures resulted in the homogenization of fracture roughness in all directions. These results confirm the important link among petrofabric analysis, fracture toughness, and fracture roughness in response to thermal treatment. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, Basel 2009.},

Several investigators have proposed a mathematical model in terms of an initial-boundary value problem to describe fluid flow in a transient pulse test. However, the solution of this problem has not been available. In analyzing data from the transient pulse test, previous investigators have either employed analytical solutions that are derived with the use of additional, restrictive assumptions, or have resorted to numerical methods. In Part I of this paper, a general, analytical solution for the transient pulse test is presented. This solution is graphically illustrated by plots of dimensionless variables for several cases of interest. The solution is shown to contain, as limiting cases, the more restrictive analytical solutions that the previous investigators have derived. A method of computing both the permeability and specific storage of the test sample from experimental data will be presented in Part II. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, a large understanding has been gained on the elastic properties of rocks. Rocks are, however, porous materials, which properties depend on both response of the bulk material and of the pores. Because in that case both the applied external pressure and the fluid pressure play a role, different poroelasticity coefficients exist. While theoretical relations exist, measuring precisely those different coefficients remains an experimental challenge. Accounting for the different experimental complexities, a new methodology is designed that allows attaining accurately a large set of compressibility and poroelasticity coefficients in porous and permeable rocks. This new method relies on the use of forced confining or pore fluid pressure oscillations. In total, seven independent coefficients have been measured using three different boundary conditions. Because the usual theories predict only four independent coefficients, this overdetermined set of data can be checked against existing thermodynamic relations. Measurements have been performed on a Bentheim sandstone under, water- and glycerine-saturated conditions for different values of confining and pore fluid pressure. Consistently with the poroelasticity theory, the effect of the fluid bulk modulus is observed under undrained conditions but not under drained ones. Using thermodynamic relations, (i) the unjacketed, quartz, and skeleton (Zimmerman's relation) bulk moduli fit, (ii) the drained and undrained properties fit, and (iii) it is directly inferred from the measurements that the pore skeleton compressibility Cϕ is expected to be constant with pressure and to be exceedingly near the bulk skeleton Cs and mineral Cm compressibility coefficients.},

abstract = {The dependence of fluid-saturated rocks' elastic properties to the measuring frequency is related to fluid-flow phenomena at different scales. In the frequency range of (Formula presented.) Hz, for fully saturated rocks, two phenomena have been experimentally documented: (i) the drained/undrained transition (i.e., global flow), and (ii) the relaxed/unrelaxed transition (i.e., local flow). When investigating experimentally those effects or comparing different measurements in rocks, one needs to account for both the boundary conditions involved and the method of measurement used. A one-dimensional poroelastic model is presented, which aims at calculating the expected poroelastic response during an experiment. The model is used to test different sets of boundary conditions, as well as the role of the measuring setup, i.e., local (strain gauges) or global (linear variable differential transformer) strain measurement. Four properties are predicted and compared with the measurements, i.e., bulk modulus, bulk attenuation, pseudo-Skempton coefficient, and pore pressure phase shift. For the drained/undrained transition, because fluid pressure may not be homogeneous in the sample, local and global measurements are predicted to differ. Furthermore, the existence of a dead volume at both sample's ends is shown to be important. Due to the existence of the dead volume, an interplay between sample's and dead volumes' storage capacity determines both the magnitudes and the frequency dependence of the dispersion/attenuation measurements. The predicted behaviours are shown to be consistent with the measurements recently reported on very compressible and porous sandstone samples.},

In this paper, methods of measurement are described for the determination of the elastic coefficients of the theory.

Any combination of measurements which is sufficient to fix the properties of the system may be used to determine the coefficients. For an isotropic system, in which there are four coefficients, the four measurements of shear modulus, jacketed and unjacketed compressibility, and coefficient of fluid content, together with a measurement of porosity appear to be the most convenient. The porosity is not required if the variables and coefficients are expressed in the proper way. The coefficient of fluid content is a measure of the volume of fluid entering the pores of a solid sample during an unjacketed compressibility test. The stressstrain relations may be expressed in terms of the stresses and strains produced during the various measurements, to give four expressions relating the measured coefficients to the original coefficients of the consolidation theory. The same method is easily extended to cases of anisotropy. The theory is directly applicable to linear systems but also may be applied to incremental variations in nonlinear systems provided the stresses are defined properly.},

The compatibility relations between these two types of moduli are examined for several classes of anisotropic solid skeletons and the information required from the undrained moduli is exactly defined through a spectral analysis of the dyadic difference in tensor compliances. A switch of the results is possible if the undrained moduli are given instead of the drained moduli. An incomplete data set of material coefficients for a transverse isotropic shale is treated as an example.

abstract = {In situ rock is often saturated with fluid, the presence of which affects both elastic parameters and inelastic deformation processes. Techniques were developed for testing fluid-saturated porous rock under the limiting conditions of drained (long-term), undrained (short-term) and unjacketed (solid matrix) response in hydrostatic, axisymmetric and plane-strain compression. Drained and undrained poroelastic parameters, including bulk modulus, Biot and Skempton coefficients, of Berea sandstone were found to be stress dependent up to 35 MPa mean stress, and approximately constant at higher levels of loading. The unjacketed bulk modulus was measured to be constant for pressure up to 60 MPa, and it appears to be larger than the unjacketed pore bulk modulus. An elasto-plastic constitutive model calibrated with parameters from drained tests provided a first-order approximation of undrained inelastic deformation: dilatant hardening was observed due to pore pressure decrease during inelastic deformation of rock specimens with constant fluid content.This article is part of the themed issue 'Energy and the subsurface'.},

@article{Berryman2010,
abstract = {Poroelastic analysis usually progresses from assumed knowledge of dry or drained porous media to the predicted behavior of fluid-saturated and undrained porous media. Unfortunately, the experimental situation is often incompatible with these assumptions, especially when field data (from hydrological or oil/gas reservoirs) are involved. The present work considers several different experimental scenarios typified by one in which a set of undrained poroelastic (stiffness) constants has been measured using either ultrasound or seismic wave analysis, while some or all of the dry or drained constants are normally unknown. Drained constants for such a poroelastic system can be deduced for isotropic systems from available data if a complete set of undrained compliance data for the principal stresses are available – together with a few other commonly measured quantities such as porosity, fluid bulk modulus, and grain bulk modulus. Similar results are also developed here for anisotropic systems having up to orthotropic symmetry if the system is granular (i.e., composed of solid grains assembled into a solid matrix, either by a cementation process or by applied stress) and the grains are known to be elastically homogeneous. Finally, the analysis is also fully developed for anisotropic systems with nonhomogeneous (more than one mineral type), but still isotropic, grains – as well as for uniform collections of anisotropic grains as long as their axes of symmetry are either perfectly aligned or perfectly random.},

@article{Kranz1990,
abstract = {Borrowing from the literature on thermal diffusivity measurements with oscillating boundary conditions, we developed and tested a methodology to measure hydraulic diffusivity of rock samples in the laboratory. The method uses a pore pressure oscillation superimposed upon the ambient pore pressure at one end of the rock sample. Unlike the transient pulse technique, which requires re-equilibration between discrete measurements, and decay curve matching for true permeability, this method allows continuous measurements during slow changes in the state of the rock-environment system. This is particularly useful for time-dependent diffusivity measurements during creep or consolidation of rock. When both the amplitude ratio and the phase difference between the upstream and downstream reservoir pressures can be measured, the method allows calculation of both diffusivity and permeability at the same time. With both of these quantities known, along with the other system parameters, interconnected porosity changes may be calculated. There are some drawbacks to the methodology. The optimum frequency of oscillation and the ratio of downstream to upstream pore pressures depend upon sample size and the magnitude of permeability, so there is a practical limit to the range of measurable diffusivities. For 11 cm long samples of Berea sandstone with a diffusivity on the order of 300 cm2/sec for example, an oscillation period of about 1 sec is appropriate. In the same size sample of Tennessee sandstone, with a diffusivity on the order of 0.25 cm2/sec, periods between 500 and 1000 sec are appropriate. Granites require pore pressure oscillation periods on the order of 1 hr or more.},

abstract = {Hydrostatic and triaxial compression experiments have been conducted to investigate the evolution of fluid permeability and fluid storage capacity in Tennessee sandstone, a low-porosity 'tight' reservoir sandstone. A newly-developed single-ended transient pulse permeability measurement technique has been used for this study. Under hydrostatic stress, both permeability and specific storage are demonstrated to be dependent upon effective confining pressure. The evolution of axial permeability as a function of increasing compressive deviatoric axial stress has been investigated in triaxial compression experiments. All samples were deformed within the brittle faulting regime. Both permeability and specific storage decrease during compaction, and subsequently increase when axially-aligned dilatant microcracking becomes dominant. Brittle failure is sometimes accompanied by a transient increase in permeability by as much as 1.5 orders of magnitude. Following brittle failure the permeability is controlled by the properties of the fault rock. Permeability decreases as stable sliding occurs on the fault up to large axial strains, such that the fault may act as an impermeable seal to migrating fluids.},

abstract = {Permeability in tight crustal rocks is primarily controlled by the connected porosity, shape and orientation of microcracks, the preferred orientation of cross-bedding, and sedimentary features such as layering. This leads to a significant permeability anisotropy. Less well studied, however, are the effects of time and stress recovery on the evolution of the permeability hysteresis which is becoming increasingly important in areas ranging from fluid migration in ore-forming processes to enhanced resource extraction. Here, we report new data simulating spatio-temporal permeability changes induced using effective pressure, simulating burial depth, on a tight sandstone (Crab Orchard). We find an initially (measured at 5MPa) anisotropy of 2.5% in P-wave velocity and 180% in permeability anisotropy is significantly affected by the direction of the effective pressure change and cyclicity; anisotropy values decrease to 1% and 10% respectively after 3cycles to 90MPa and back. Furthermore, we measure a steadily increasing recovery time (10–20min) for flow parallel to cross-bedding, and a far slower recovery time (20–50min) for flow normal to cross-bedding. These data are interpreted via strain anisotropy and accommodation models, similar to the “seasoning” process often used in dynamic reservoir extraction.},

The exact expressions found for the pore compressibility, P, and the shear compliance, Q, are valid for any value of the aspect ratio $\alpha$, from zero (cracks) to infinity (needles). This derivation clarifies previous work on this problem, in which different methods were used in different ranges of $\alpha$, or typographical errors were present. The exact expressions obtained for P and Q are quite complex and unwieldy. Simple expressions for both P and Q have previously been available for the limiting cases of infinitely thin-cracks ($\alpha$=0), infinitely long-needles ($\alpha$=∞), and spherical pores ($\alpha$=1). We have now calculated additional terms in the asymptotic expansions, yielding relatively simple approximations for P and Q that are valid for crack-like pores having aspect ratios as high as 0.3, needle-like pores having aspect ratios as low as 3, and nearly spherical pores. Their relatively simple forms will be useful for incorporation into various schemes to estimate the effective elastic moduli.},

abstract = {The evolution of $V_\mathrm{P}/V_\mathrm{S}$ with increasing fluid-saturated porosity is computed for isotropic rocks containing spheroidal pores. $V_\mathrm{P}/V_\mathrm{S}$ is shown to either decrease or increase with increasing porosity, depending on the aspect ratio $\alpha$ of the pores, fluid to solid bulk modulus ratio $\zeta$, and initial Poisson's ratio $\nu_0$ of the solid. A critical initial Poisson's ratio $\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$ is computed, separating cases where $V_\mathrm{P}/V_\mathrm{S}$ increases (if $\nu_0<\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$) or \emph{decreases} (if $\nu_0>\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$) with increasing porosity. For thin cracks and highly compressible fluids, $\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$ is approximated by $0.157\,\zeta/\alpha$, whereas for spherical pores $\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$ is given by $0.2 + 0.8\zeta$. If $\nu_0$ is close to $\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$, the evolution of $V_\mathrm{P}/V_\mathrm{S}$ with increasing fluid-saturated porosity is near neutral and depends on subtle changes in pore shape and fluid properties. This regime is found to be relevant to partially dehydrated serpentinites in subduction zone conditions (porosity of aspect ratio near 0.1 and $\zeta$ in the range 0.01--0.1), and makes detection of these rocks and possibly elevated fluid pressures difficult from $V_\mathrm{P}/V_\mathrm{S}$ only.},

abstract = {[ 1] On the basis of field observations and geodetic measurements we analyzed coseismic and postseismic deformation of the 2003, M-w = 6.5, Chengkung earthquake across the rupture trace of the Chihshang fault, which lies along the suture zone between the Philippine Sea plate and the Eurasian plate in eastern Taiwan. At three of our investigation sites along the Chihshang fault the earthquake deformation was exhibited by fresh fractures within the 150- to 200-m-wide surface fault zone, reactivating preexisting fractures in most cases. In addition to daily recorded creep meter data, geodetic measurements, including leveling, distance-and-angle electronic distance meters, and GPS measurements, were carried out during surveys 20 - 25 days before, 20 - 25 days after, and 120 - 125 days after the earthquake. The near - fault surface deformation is mainly characterized by anticlinal folding in the hanging wall and minor gentle synclinal folding in the footwall. The geodetic data show that within our 150- to 250-m-wide networks the coseismic deformation of the main shock produced only about 1 - 2 cm of horizontal shortening and vertical offset across the fault zone. A larger additional displacement of about 7 - 9 cm for both the horizontal shortening and the vertical offset occurred as postseismic creep during the 120 - 125 days following the main shock. We interpret the predominant folding and the rather large postseismic creep as a result of strong velocity strengthening along the fault plane near the surface, which caused locking or coupling effect during the coseismic rupturing. The depth of locked segment, along which the coseismic and postseismic slip decreased dramatically upward, is estimated to be 25 - 100 m, depending on the site. We interpreted the velocity strengthening and coupling effect at the shallow level as viscoelastic behavior of unconsolidated deposits in the footwall and melange mudstone in the hanging wall. By incorporating far-fault continuous GPS data, it was found that minor but significant deformation occurred outside of the surface ruptures zone of the Chihshang fault. In addition, a possible back thrust or back fold might have occurred in the hanging wall. We note that the Chengkung earthquake occurred during the dry season. This is consistent with the fact that the mechanical coupling of the fault at shallow depth is higher during drier periods, inferred from the previous seasonal creep data. At outcrop scale, regarding damage of construction such as a concrete retaining wall, most of the coseismic and postseismic horizontal shortening was essentially absorbed by multiple distributed brittle ruptures, which deserves attention in terms of earthquake hazard mitigation.},

abstract = {Acoustic emission (AE) and active ultrasonic wave velocity monitoring are often performed during laboratory rock deformation experiments, but are typically processed separately to yield homogenized wave velocity measurements and approximate source locations. Here, I present a numerical method and its implementation in a free software to perform a joint inversion of AE locations together with the 3-D, anisotropic P-wave structure of laboratory samples. The data used are the P-wave first arrivals obtained from AEs and active ultrasonic measurements. The model parameters are the source locations and the P-wave velocity and anisotropy parameter (assuming transverse isotropy) at discrete points in the material. The forward problem is solved using the fast marching method, and the inverse problem is solved by the quasi-Newton method. The algorithms are implemented within an integrated free software package called FaATSO (Fast Marching Acoustic Emission Tomography using Standard Optimisation). The code is employed to study the formation of compaction bands in a porous sandstone. During deformation, a front of AEs progresses from one end of the sample, associated with the formation of a sequence of horizontal compaction bands. Behind the active front, only sparse AEs are observed, but the tomography reveals that the P-wave velocity has dropped by up to 15 per cent, with an increase in anisotropy of up to 20 per cent. Compaction bands in sandstones are therefore shown to produce sharp changes in seismic properties. This result highlights the potential of the methodology to image temporal variations of elastic properties in complex geomaterials, including the dramatic, localized changes associated with microcracking and damage generation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. The Authors. Although geological, seismological, and geophysical evidence indicates that fracture damage and physical properties of fault-related rocks are intimately linked, their relationships remain poorly constrained. Here we correlate quantitative observations of microfracture damage within the exhumed Gole Larghe Fault Zone (Italian Southern Alps) with ultrasonic wave velocities and permeabilities measured on samples collected along a 1.5-km-long transect across the fault zone. Ultrasonic velocity and permeability correlate systematically with the measured microfracture intensity. In the center of the fault zone where microfractures were pervasively sealed, P wave velocities are the highest and permeability is relatively low. However, neither the crack porosity nor the permeability derived by modeling the velocity data using an effective-medium approach correlates well with the microstructural and permeability measurements, respectively. The applied model does not account for sealing of microfractures but assumes that all variations in elastic properties are due to microfracturing. Yet we find that sealing of microfractures affects velocities significantly in the more extensively altered samples. Based on the derived relationships between microfracture damage, elastic and hydraulic properties, and mineralization history, we (i) assess to what extent wave velocities can serve as a proxy for damage structure and (ii) use results on the present-day physical and microstructural properties to derive information about possible postseismic recovery processes. Our estimates of velocity changes associated with sealing of microfractures quantitatively agree with seismological observations of velocity recovery following earthquakes, which suggests that the recovery is at least in part due to the sealing of microfractures.},

abstract = {To understand the relationship between pore space anisotropy and petrophysical properties, we developed a novel apparatus capable of simultaneously measuring permeability, porosity and ultrasonic velocities at hydrostatic pressures up to 100 MPa. First, we use magnetic susceptibilities and acoustic wave velocities to identify the principal anisotropy axes under ambient laboratory conditions. This directional anisotropy data is then used to guide experiments on two sandstones (Bentheim and Crab Orchard) under hydrostatic pressure from 5 to 90 MPa. We find the structural anisotropy formed by the void space is well described by velocity anisotropy in both cases. Under hydrostatic pressure, the acoustic anisotropy of Crab Orchard sandstone (COS) decreases from 3% and 7% at 5 MPa (P-wave and S-wave) to 1.5% and 1%, respectively, at effective pressures over 40 MPa; for Bentheim sandstone the decrease is considerably less. Permeability of COS is 125 × 10-18 m2, decreasing rapidly as effective pressure increases, with permeability parallel to bedding approximately twice that normal to bedding. In contrast, permeability of Bentheim sandstone is 0.86 × 10-12 m2, and varies little with effective pressure or coring direction. We relate many of our measurements made under hydrostatic pressure to the contrasting pore fabric between the two rock types, and infer that a critical pressure is required for the initiation of crack closure. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite containing a high level of pre-existing microcrack damage, Etna basalt retains a high strength of 475 MPa. We have monitored the complete deformation cycle through contemporaneous measurements of axial strain, pore volume change, compressional wave velocity change and acoustic emission (AE) output. We have been able to follow the complete evolution of the throughgoing shear fault without recourse to any artificial means of slowing the deformation. Locations of AE events over time yields an estimate of the fault propagation velocity of between 2 and 4 mm. s(-1). We also find excellent agreement between AE locations and post-test images from X-ray microtomography scanning that delineates deformation zone architecture.},

abstract = {Cracks play a major role in most rocks submitted to crustal conditions. Mechanically, cracks make the rock much more compliant. They also make it much easier for fluid to flow through any rock body. Relying on Fracture Mechanics and Statistical Physics, we introduce a few key concepts, which allow to understand and quantify how cracks do modify both the elastic and transport properties of rocks. The main different schemes, which can be used to derive the elastic effective moduli of a rock, are presented. It is shown from experimental results that an excellent approximation is the so-called non-interactive scheme. The main consequences of the existence of cracks on the elastic waves is the development of elastic anisotropy (due to the anisotropic distribution of crack orientations) and the dispersion effect (due to microscopic local fluid flow). At a larger scale, macroscopic fluid flow takes place through the crack network above the percolation threshold. Two macroscopic fluid flow regimes can be distinguished: the percolative regime close to the percolation threshold and the connected regime well above it. Experimental data on very different rock types show both of these behaviors.},

abstract = {This is a study of the formulation, some basic solutions, and applications of the Biot linearized quasi-static elasticity theory of fluid-infiltrated porous materials. Whereas most previously solved problems are based on idealizing the fluid and solid constituents as separately incompressible, full account is taken here of constituent compressibility. Previous studies are reviewed and the Biot constitutive equations relating strain and fluid mass content to stress and pore pressure are recast in terms of new matorial parameters, more directly open to physical interpretation as the Poisson ratio and induced pore pressure coefficient in undrained deformation. Different formulations of the coupled deformation/diffusion field equations and their analogues in coupled thermoelasticity are discussed, and a new formulation with stress and pore pressure as basic variables is presented that leads, for plane problems, to a convenient complex variable representation of solutions. The problems solved include those of the suddenly introduced edge disloca-tion and concentrated line force and of the suddenly pressurized cylindrical and spherical cavity. The dislocation solution is employed to represent that for quasi-static motions along a shear fault, and a discussion is given, based on fracture mechanics models for fault propagation, of phenomena involving coupled behavior between the rupturing solid and its pore fluid, which could serve to stabilize a fault against rapid spreading. Also, the solution for a pressurized cylindrical cavity leads to a time-dependent stress field near the cavity wall, and its relevance to time effects in the inception of hydraulic fractures from boreholes, or from drilled holes in laboratory specimens, is discussed. Various limiting cases are identified, and numerical values of the controlling porous media elastic parameters are given for several rocks.},

abstract = {Aseries of triaxial compression experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of induced stress on the anisotropy developed in dynamic elastic and poroelastic parameters in rocks. The measurements were accomplished by utilizing an array of piezoelectric compressional and shear wave sensors mounted around a cylindrical sample of porous Berea sandstone. Three different types of applied states of stress were investigated using hydrostatic, triaxial, and uniaxial strain experiments. During the hydrostatic experiment, where an isotropic state of stress was applied to an isotropic porous rock, the vertical and horizontal acoustic velocities and dynamic elastic moduli increased as pressure was applied and no evidence of stress induced anisotropy was visible. The poroelastic moduli ?Biot's effective stress parameter, ?? decreased during the test but also with no evidence of anisotropy. The triaxial compression test involved an axisymmetric application of stress with an axial stress greater than the two constant equal lateral stresses. During this test a marked anisotropy developed in the acoustic velocities, and in the dynamic elastic and poroelastic moduli. As axial stress increased the magnitude of the anisotropy increased as well. The uniaxial strain test involved axisymmetric application of stresses with increasing axial and lateral stresses but while maintaining a zero lateral strain condition. The uniaxial strain test exhibited a quite different behavior from either the triaxial or hydrostatic tests. As both the axial and lateral stresses were increased, an anisotropy developed early in the loading phase but then was effectively “locked in” with little or no change in the magnitude of the values of the acoustic velocities, or the dynamic elastic and poroelastic parameters as stresses were increased. These experimental results show that the application of triaxial states of stress induced significant anisotropy in the elastic and poroelastic parameters in porous rock, while under the uniaxial strain condition the poromechanics, Biot's effective stress parameter, exhibited the largest variation among the three test conditions},

Various approaches to the problem are discussed; they are further assessed by comparing their predictions to results for sample deterministic arrays. These computer experiments indicate that the approximation of non- interacting cracks has a wider than expected range of applicability. Some of the deficiencies of various approximate schemes seem to be related to inadequacy of the conventionally used crack density parameter (insensitive to mutual positions of cracks). An alternative parameter that has this sensitivity, is suggested. Finally, the problem of effective moduli is discussed in the context of "damage mechanics". It is argued that, contrary to the spirit of many damage models, there is no direct quantitative correlation between progression of a microcracking solid towards fracture and deterioration of its stiffness; thus, the effective moduli may not always serve as a reliable indicator of damage. 1.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on fundamentals of poroelasticity. The presence of a freely moving fluid in a porous rock modifies its mechanical response. Two mechanisms play a key role in the interaction between the interstitial fluid and the porous rock: (i) an increase of pore pressure induces a dilation of the rock; and (ii) compression of the rock causes a rise of pore pressure, if the fluid is prevented from escaping the pore network. These coupled mechanisms bestow an apparent time-dependent character to the mechanical properties of the rock. If excess pore pressure, induced by compression of the rock, is allowed to dissipate through diffusive fluid mass transport, further deformation of the rock progressively takes place. The rock is more compliant under drained conditions than undrained ones. The chapter discusses the formulation and analysis of coupled deformation–diffusion processes, within the framework of the Biot theory of poroelasticity. The Biot model of a fluid-filled porous material is constructed on the conceptual model of a coherent solid skeleton and a freely moving pore fluid.},

A bifurcation analysis is performed to study the failure mode in sands under true triaxial stress conditions at the material response level. It is shown that either uniform failure or localized failure can occur, depending on the intermediate principal stress. Uniform bifurcation occurs in tests along stress paths with a lower Lode angle, including the stress path for a conventional triaxial compression test. Localized failure occurs in tests along stress paths with a higher Lode angle, including stress paths for biaxial compression and triaxial extension tests. Specimen responses under laboratory conditions are then studied numerically by 3D FE simulations of biaxial compression, triaxial compression, and triaxial extension tests. The effects of initial imperfection from a homogeneous state are taken into account by introducing a frequency distribution of the initial void ratio.

When all principal stresses are compressive, experiments demonstrate that the criterion applies reasonably well to rock, where the uniaxial compressive strength C 0 is much greater than the uniaxial tensile strength T, e.g. C 0/T > 10; some modification is needed when tensile stresses act, because the (theoretical) uniaxial tensile strength T 0 predicted from MC is not measured in experiments. The MC criterion can be considered as a contribution from Mohr and Coulomb (Nadai 1950). Mohr's condition is based on the assumption that failure depends only on $\sigma$I and $\sigma$III, and the shape of the failure envelope, the loci of $\sigma$, $\tau$ acting on a failure plane, can be linear or nonlinear (Mohr 1900). Coulomb's condition is based on a linear failure envelope to determine the critical combination of $\sigma$, $\tau$ that will cause failure on some plane (Coulomb 1776). A linear failure criterion with an intermediate stress effect was described by Paul (1968) and implemented by Meyer and Labuz (2012).},

abstract = {We present a model for the nucleation and growth of faults in intact brittle rocks. The model is based on recent experiments that utilize acoustic emission events to monitor faulting processes in Westerly granite. In these experiments a fault initiated at one site without significant preceding damage. The fault propagated in its own plane with a leading zone of intense microcracking. We propose here that faults in granites nucleate and propagate by the interaction of tensile microcracks in the following style. During early loading, tensile microcracking occurs randomly, with no significant crack interaction and with no relation to the location or inclination of the future fault. As the load reaches the ultimate strength, nucleation initiates when a few tensile microcracks interact and enhance the dilation of one another. They create a process zone that is a region with closely spaced microcracks. In highly loaded rock, the stress field associated with microcrack dilation forces crack interaction to spread in an unstable manner and recursive geometry. Thus the process zone propagates unstably into the intact rock. As the process zone lengthens, its central part yields by shear and a fault nucleus forms. The fault nucleus grows in the wake of the propagating process zone. The stress fields associated with shear along the fault further enhance the microcrack dilation in the process zone. The analysis shows that faults should propagate in their own plane, making an angle of 20°&#8211;30° with the maximum compression axis. This model provides a physical basis for &#8220;internal friction,&#8221; the empirical parameter of the Coulomb criterion.},

abstract = {Multiple faults, composed of three, four or more sets of faults, have been observed at a wide range of scales, from clay experiments to rift valleys. Multiple faults usually are explained by multiple phases of deformation. However, in several cases the multiple faults develop simultaneously; therefore, they cannot be explained by the common theories of faulting. Furthermore, these theories were derived for plane strain, whereas, multiple faults are associated with three-dimensional strain. An elementary analysis of faulting in three-dimensional strain field is presented here. The analysis considers the deformation of an idealized model due to slip along sets of faults; the model is subjected to strain boundary conditions. The analysis shows that (1) three or four sets of faults are necessary to accommodate three-dimensional strain, (2) there is a combination of four fault sets which minimize the dissipation of the defor- mation; the orientation of these faults depend on the strain state, and (3) if the resistance to slip along these four sets of faults is cohesive, then the stresses which cause slippage along them are equal or larger than the yielding stresses of a Tresca rigid-plastic with the same cohesion. The analysis presented here is too elementary to be directly applied to field observa- tions; however, it indicates that multiple faults and rhomboid patterns of faults probably form},

The aim of the research presented here is to provide a direct link between macroscopically observed global stress-strain behavior and the development of damage mechanisms within the specimens. A novel experimental procedure is introduced to monitor the changes in the material during a conventional multiaxial compression test. This procedure, comprising small stress probes repeated at selected points of the stress-strain history, is designed to provide data on the tangent stiffness operator and the associated acoustic tensors.

From the examples presented for the study of the potential breakout orientation, it is shown that the previously held perception that borehole breakout orientation is aligned always with the azimuth of $\delta$h (the least horizontal principal stress) may not be true, because borehole breakout orientations have been shown to depend on the tectonic stress regime or the relative magnitudes of the in-situ far-field horizontal principal stresses with respect to vertical stresses. In addition, it is demonstrated that compressive failure criteria for rocks influence both the breakout azimuth and the extent of the initial failure zone, and, in general, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion tends to predict larger breakouts than are predicted by other criteria taking into account the effect of the intermediate principal stress. This program can be applied to study the relationship between breakout azimuth, breakout width, the in-situ stress field, and wellbore stability in relation to rock strength and the effects of mud weight and pore pressure in the rock formation. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {This paper reviews some strength criteria which include the role of the intermediate principal stress, and proposes a new criterion. Strength criteria of the form $\sigma$oct=fN($\sigma$oct), such as Drucker-Prager, represent a rotation surface in the principal stress space, symmetric to the line $\sigma$1=$\sigma$2=$\sigma$3in the meridian plane. Because $\sigma$oct=fN($\sigma$oct) must fit the pseudo-triaxial compressive strength, it will have a non-physical outcome for triaxial extension. Mogi's criteria, $\sigma$oct=g1($\sigma$m,2) and $\sigma$max=g2($\sigma$$\beta$) are able to fit experimental data reasonably well, but the prediction of strength is not good and sometimes problematic. Strength criterion with the form $\lambda$($\sigma$1, $\sigma$2, $\sigma$3)=F[$\eta$($\sigma$1, $\sigma$2, $\sigma$3)], or a curve of two variables which can be decided by fitting pseudo-triaxial experimental data, is not expected to describe the strength under various stress states, no matter how high the correlation coefficient of $\lambda$ and $\eta$ is, or how low the misfit of the equation $\lambda$=F($\eta$) is, as these seemingly good correlations usually result from the dominant influence of the maximum principal stress in the metrics of $\lambda$ and $\eta$. The intermediate principal stress may improve the strength of rock specimen, but its influence will be restricted by $\sigma$3. Also when $\sigma$2is high enough to cause failure in the $\sigma$2-$\sigma$3direction, the strength will decrease with the increasing $\sigma$2. The new strength criterion with exponent form has just such a character, and gives much lower misfits than do all seven criteria discussed by Colmenares and Zoback [Colmenares LB, Zoback MD.

The one array considered in detail consists of long cracks having a preferred orientation superimposed on a field of randomly oriented small cracks. Fracture in tension and in compression is considered. The fracture criterion found for compression resembles a similar criterion suggested by Jaeger on a somewhat different basis; it predicts behavior which is in good agreement with observed fracture of a slate reported by Donath.

abstract = {ABSTRACT:To clarify the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the strength and deformational behavior of rocks, three sandstones, marble, and shale were deformed under true triaxial stress state in which the intermediate principal stress is not equal to the minimum nor to the maximum principal stress. Failure strength increased with the relative increase of the intermediate principal stress except for the stress state where the intermediate principal stress approaches to the maximum stress. The relative increase of intermediate principal stress induced also changes the deformation of rock from the ductile mode to the more brittle mode. The difference between the intermediate principal strain and minimum principal strain increased markedly with increment of the intermediate principal stress. The fracture stability of rock specimen was suggested by the concept of the effective shear strain energy stored around the closed microcracks. The deformational anisotropy was indicated by the preferred orientation of stress-induced open microcracks.1 INTRODUCTION:The Physical behavior of rock under triaxial stress state is essentially important for the underground mining and for the utilization of underground spaces for example, tunnels, electric powerhouse, storages of gas and oil, open pit mine, and high level waste repository and so on), because the act of excavations changes the stress fields and other physical and mechanical environments of rocks around the underground open space. The underground rock body is subjected to the initial stress prior to excavation. In many cases, it can be adequately assumed that the vertical normal stress is equal to the weight of the overlying rock mass, usually, 25-27MPa/Km on the average. The magnitude of the horizontal stresses lie widely between 0.5 and 3.5 times as large as the vertical normal stress at the depth shallower than 1000m(Brown and Hoek,1978). These observations suggest that the three principal stresses are different each others for many cases of initial. In order to investigate the mechanical characteristics of rocks around the underground openings, we have to adopt the testing equipment with which three different principal stresses can be reproduced precisely. The so-called triaxial compression test has been proved to be the most adequate and convenient testing method for the study of the mechanical characteristics of rocks for wide variety of confining pressures. In the conventional triaxial compression test, the longitudinal axial load is applied parallel to the axis of a cylindrical rock specimen through steel end pieces and the other stresses(confining pressure) are the cylinder by a fluid medium. The relatively homogeneous stress distribution can be produced in the specimen with the conventional triaxial test(confining pressure test). However, the intermediate principal stress is fixed equal to the minimum principal stress(compression test under confining pressure), in fewer cases, to the maximum principal stress(extension test under confining pressure), because the stress state in the confining pressure test is essentially axially symmetrical. According to the confining pressure experiments, failure strength increased remarkably with increase of the confining pressure, and relative transition from brittle to ductile behaviors is observed by the increase of the confining pressure.},

abstract = {Deformation bands form in porous granular rocks by localized inelastic yielding that is well described by a modified Cam cap model. All five kinematic varieties of bands observed in the field, including dilation bands, dilation bands with shear, shear bands, compaction bands with shear, and compaction bands, can be explained by this unifying mechanical framework once their localization criteria are also specified. The growth of dilation bands with shear has been observed in the field and in the laboratory for low-pressure conditions. More commonly, however, strain hardening of compaction bands with shear will lead to faulting within, and eventually through, the resulting damage zone if the associated yield cap grows outward sufficiently to intersect the frictional strength surface. This sequence is best explained by replacing the critical state line with a frictional failure criterion in the general Cam cap approach. Given recent advances in localization theory and continuing refinement of field observations, the term "fracture" must now be expanded to include both weak and strong discontinuities, or deformation bands and displacement discontinuities (i.e., cracks, joints, veins, solution surfaces, anticracks, dikes, sills, faults), respectively. Shear zones and fault zones that accommodate both continuous and discontinuous changes in shear offset within them should also be considered as fractures according to this expanded definition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have shown that linear Mogi criterion does a good job in representing rock failure under polyaxial stress states. When $\sigma$2= $\sigma$3the linear version of Mogi's triaxial failure criterion reduces exactly to the Coulomb criterion. Hence, the linear Mogi criterion can be thought of as a natural extension of the Coulomb criterion into three dimensions (i.e., polyaxial stress space). As Mohr's extension of the Coulomb criterion into three dimensions is often referred to as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, we propose that the linear version of the Mogi criterion be known as the "Mogi-Coulomb" failure criterion. The classical Coulomb failure criterion can therefore be thought of as a special case, which applies only when $\sigma$2= $\sigma$3of the more general linear Mogi failure criterion. Furthermore, we found that the numerical values of the parameters that appear in the Mogi-Coulomb criterion can be estimated from conventional triaxial test data. Thus, this polyaxial failure criterion can be applied even in the absence of polyaxial (true triaxial) data. This offers a great advantage, as most laboratories are equipped to conduct only traditional $\sigma$2= $\sigma$3tests. Finally, we showed that if the linear form of the Mogi criterion is used, the parameters that appear in it can be unambiguously related to the traditional parameters appearing in the Coulomb failure law. The lack of such a relationship for the parameters appearing in the power-law Mogi criterion has been cited in [8] as a major drawback to the use of that model. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional triaxial tests in these rocks reveal that their respective strengths in a specific orientation increase approximately linearly with confining pressure. True triaxial compression experiments in specimens oriented at a consistent angle to banding, in which the magnitudes of the least ($\sigma$3) and the intermediate ($\sigma$2) principal stresses are different but kept constant during testing while the maximum principal stress is increased until failure, exhibit a behavior unlike that previously observed in other rocks under similar testing conditions. For a given magnitude of $\sigma$3, compressive strength $\sigma$1does not vary significantly in both Long Valley rock types, regardless of the applied $\sigma$2, suggesting little or no intermediate principal stress effect. Strains measured in all three principal directions during loading were used to obtain plots of $\sigma$1versus volumetric strain. These are consistently linear almost to the point of rock failure, suggesting no dilatancy. The phenomenon was corroborated by SEM inspection of failed specimens that showed no microcrack development prior to the emergence of one through-going shear failure plane steeply dipping in the $\sigma$3direction. The strong dependency of compressive strength on the intermediate principal stress in other crystalline rocks was found to be related to microcrack initiation upon dilatancy onset, which rises with increased $\sigma$2and retards the failure process. We infer that strength independence of $\sigma$2in the Long Valley rocks derives directly from their non-dilatant deformation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study we examine seven different failure criteria by comparing them to published polyaxial test data (s1 > s2 > s3) for five different rock types at a variety of stress states. We employed a grid search algorithm to find the best set of parameters that describe failure for each criterion and the associated misfits. Overall, we found that the polyaxial criteria Modified Wiebols and Cook and Modified Lade achieved a good fit to most of the test data. This is especially true for rocks with a highly s2-dependent failure behavior (e.g. Dunham dolomite, Solenhofen limestone). However, for some rock types (e.g. Shirahama Sandstone, Yuubari shale), the intermediate stress hardly affects failure and the Mohr–Coulomb and Hoek and Brown criteria fit these test data equally well, or even better, than the more complicated polyaxial criteria. The values of C0 yielded by the Inscribed and the Circumscribed Drucker– Prager criteria bounded the C0 value obtained using the Mohr–Coulomb criterion as expected. In general, the Drucker–Prager failure criterion did not accurately indicate the value of s1 at failure. The value of the misfits achieved with the empirical 1967 and 1971 Mogi criteria were generally in between those obtained using the triaxial and the polyaxial criteria. The disadvantage of these failure criteria is that they cannot be related to strength parameters such as C0: We also found that if only data from triaxial tests are available, it is possible to incorporate the influence of s2 on failure by using a polyaxial failure criterion. The results for two out of three rocks that could be analyzed in this way were encouraging.},

abstract = {We synthesize all the available data on failure processes in granular rock and provide a geological framework for the corresponding structures. We describe two categories: (1) sharp discontinuities made up of two surfaces similar to elastic crack models, and (2) tabular structures resulting from strain localization into narrow bands. Each of these categories includes types predominated by shear and/or volumetric deformation. While shear failure can be in two different modes as sliding and tearing, the volumetric failure has two diametrically opposite types: compaction (contraction) and dilation (extension). Thus, we distinguish among bands predominantly by shearing, shortening, and extension. Slip surfaces, pressure solution surfaces, and joints represent corresponding sharp discontinuities. A survey of observations and measurements from naturally occurring structures indicates that although isochoric shear and pure volumetric deformation types represent end members, a complete spectrum of combined shear and volumetric deformation occurs in nature. Field observations also show that sharp structures overlap older narrow tabular structures in the same rock. This switch in failure modes is attributed to changing rock rheology and/or loading conditions. In the mathematical modeling, we focus on the strain localization into narrow tabular bands using classical bifurcation theory combined with nonlinear continuum mechanics and plasticity. We formulate a family of three invariant plasticity models with a compression cap and capture the entire spectrum of failure of geomaterials. In addition, we draw an analogy between the concepts of 'strong' and 'sharp' discontinuity and classic elastic crack representations to complement the mathematical treatment of the failure modes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The material parameters of six failure criteria were optimized for eight rocks so that least mean standard deviation misfits could be obtained. A comparison of these misfits revealed the enhancements that are possible in defining rock failure criteria as non-linear in p - q space and dependent on intermediate principal stress. The new HBMN criterion which incorporates both of these features in one failure criterion consequently gave the overall least misfit in this study. Finally, it should be noted that the HBMN criterion uses exactly the same material parameters as the HB criterion. Nevertheless, the best fit parameters for both models given in Table 3 are somewhat different: The unconfined compressive strength $\sigma$c i and the intact rock parameter mi are generally smaller within the HBMN criterion. In the case of the unconfined compressive strength this is certainly a desirable consequence. The intact rock parameters of both models equally fit the domains proposed by Hoek et al. [3]. In practical applications, the HBMN criterion can be used in the same way as the HB criterion, not only describing the behavior of intact rock, but also the behavior of rock masses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Natural and induced stress states around man-made openings in rock generally have different magnitudes along the principal axes. Accordingly, appropriate stability analyses should be based on expressions that take into account the full stress tensor. Based on the main features of compressive and tensile failure of isotropic media, the authors propose a general multiaxial criterion for describing the short-term failure (STF) strength as well as the damage initiation threshold (DIT) of rocks and rock masses. Time and size effects are explicitly included in the formulation. The influence of time is described by an extension of the subcritical crack growth theory in which the DIT is introduced. This damage initiation threshold represents the stress state below which there is virtually no crack growth, and hence corresponds to the long-term rock strength. Size effects, on the other hand, are treated using a generalized version of existing power-law expressions in which limiting values have been imposed for the relative size of representative elements. Application of the criterion to rock masses is done using simultaneously the size effect function for the case where no new types of defects are introduced, and a function of the RMR geomechanical classification to take into account the influence of new types of discontinuities such as joint sets. Sample applications of the criterion, using simplified calculations for rock structures, are shown and briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new true triaxial cell has been designed, fabricated, calibrated, and successfully tested. Its main feature is very high loading capability in all three orthogonal directions, enabling the testing to failure of hard crystalline rocks subjected to large least and intermediate principal stresses. All three principal stresses applied to rectangular prismatic specimens, 19×19×38 mm in size, are servo controlled. The cell was used to conduct an extensive series of tests in Westerly granite. A new true triaxial strength criterion for the rock was obtained that takes into account the effect of the intermediate principal stress. This turns out to be so significant that it raises serious questions about the suitability of criteria such as those named after Mohr, Coulomb, Griffith, and others. Measurements of strain in all three principal directions revealed that the onset of dilatancy relative to the major principal stress at failure rises substantially as the intermediate principal stress increases. The true triaxial tests also demonstrate that for the same least horizontal stress the main fracture dip angle in Westerly granite increases as a function of the intermediate principal stress, suggesting a strengthening effect. Limited thin section and SEM study shows that microcrack propagation, crack localization, and main fracture characteristics are basically similar to those observed in common triaxial tests.},

abstract = {Estimation of the maximum horizontal in situ stress from logged borehole-breakout dimensions in brittle elastic rocks requires knowledge of the true triaxial compressive strength of the medium. We employed our true triaxial loading apparatus to determine the strength criterion of the nearly impermeable amphibolite penetrated by the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB) superdeep scientific hole at depths of 3200&#8211;7800 m. To better simulate borehole wall conditions, we left one pair of the prismatic specimens' faces unjacketed and in direct contact with the confining fluid. This testing variation brings about a fundamentally different failure mechanism from that in fully jacketed (dry) specimens. Brittle fracture occurs at or soon after dilatancy onset and results from the development of densely spaced extensile fractures subparallel and adjacent to one of the unjacketed faces. We infer that the confining fluid intrudes newly opened microcracks, which are predominantly subparallel to the unjacketed faces, and promotes their elongation into throughgoing fractures. For any given least principal stress, the compressive strength typically increases with the rise in the intermediate principal stress. The true triaxial strength criterion of the unjacketed amphibolite can be expressed as a linear relationship between the octahedral shear stress and the octahedral normal stress at failure. Employing this criterion together with all the other known data from the KTB hole, we recomputed the magnitude of the maximum horizontal in situ stress there. Our results show that it increases steadily with depth, with a relatively narrow band of uncertainty, confirming previous assessments of a strike-slip stress regime.},

abstract = {Abstract Darley Dale and Pennant sandstones were tested under conditions of both axisymmetric shortening and extension normal to bedding. These are the two extremes of loading under polyaxial stress conditions. Failure under generalized stress conditions can be predicted from the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion under axisymmetric compression conditions provided the best form of polyaxial failure criterion is known. The sandstone data are best reconciled using the Mogi (1967) empirical criterion. Fault plane orientations produced vary greatly with respect to the maximum compression direction in the two loading configurations. The normals to the Mohr–Coulomb failure envelopes do not predict the orientations of the fault planes eventually produced. Frictional sliding on variously inclined sawcuts and failure surfaces produced in intact rock samples was also investigated. Friction coefficient is not affected by fault plane orientation in a given loading configuration, but friction coefficients in extension were systematically lower than in compression for both rock types and could be reconciled by a variant on the Mogi (1967) failure criterion. Friction data for these and other porous sandstones accord well with the Byerlee (1977) generalization about rock friction being largely independent of rock type. For engineering and geodynamic modelling purposes, the stress-state dependent friction coefficient should be used for sandstones, but it is not known to what extent this might apply to other rock types.},

abstract = {Results are presented from an initial experimental programme aimed towards evaluating the capabilities of a new true triaxial cell, designed to apply independent and unequal principal stresses to the curved surfaces of cylindrical core plugs. A series of discrete failure tests on dry specimens from two sandstone lithologies exhibiting different deformation, strength and poroperm characteristics, were conducted under azimuthal stress anisotropy ($\sigma$2> $\sigma$3) with $\sigma$1being applied axially. The true triaxial cell consistently orientates induced brittle shear fractures so that they strike parallel to the direction of $\sigma$2, and slip against the direction of least confinement, $\sigma$3. Both peak (fracture) and residual (friction) strengths are shown to be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the applied $\sigma$2, as well as on that of $\sigma$3. Results from multi-failure state testing using the conventional "triaxial" compression configuration are contrasted with discrete failure tests conducted in the true triaxial cell, by means of the familiar von Mises and extended 3-D Griffith criteria. Digitised records of shear-waves obtained at 40, 60 and 80% of peak failure strength during true triaxial testing, show clear evidence of progressively increasing stress-induced "splitting" or birefringence between the arrival of the faster S1(∥$\sigma$2) and the slower S2(∥$\sigma$3) shear-wave. Microseismic data and macroscopic observations from discrete failure tests performed within the true triaxial cell, are thus supportive of a brittle deformation mechanism involving stress-induced dilatant microcracks extending parallel to $\sigma$2and opening against $\sigma$3, progressively coalescing with increasing $\sigma$1to form a pervasive fault also oriented by the applied 3-D stress field. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {he influence of hydrostatic and uniaxial stress states on the porosity and permeability ofsandstones has been investigated. The experimental procedure uses a special triaxial cell which allowspermeability measurements in the axial and radial directions. The core sleeve is equipped with two pressuresamplers placed distant from the ends. They provide mid-length axial permeability measure as opposed to theoverall permeability measure, which is based on the flow imposed through the pistons of the triaxial cell. The coresleeve is also equipped to perform flows in two directions transverse to the axis of the sample. Two independentmeasures of axial and complementary radial permeability are thus obtained. Both Fontainebleau sandstonespecimens with a porosity of about 5.8% to 8% and low permeability ranging from 2.5mDto 30mDandBentheimer sandstone with a porosity of 24% and a high permeability of 3Dhave been tested. The initial axialpermeability values obtained by each method are in good agreement for the Fontainebleau sandstone. TheBentheimer sandstone samples present an axial mid-length permeability 1.6 times higher than the overallpermeability. A similar discrepancy is also observed in the radial direction, also it relates essentially to the shape offlow lines induced by the radial flow. All the tested samples have shown a higher stress dependency of overall andradial permeability than mid-length permeability. The effect of compaction damage at the pistons/sample andradial ports/sample interfaces is discussed. The relevance of directional permeability measurements duringcontinuous uniaxial compression loadings has been shown on the Bentheimer sandstone until the failure of thesample. We can efficiently measure the influence of brittle failure associated to dilatant regime on the permeability:It tends to increase in the failure propagation direction and to decrease strongly in the transverse direction},

The main fault core is a narrow zone of intensely comminuted grains that is a maximum of 30 cm thick and is composed of low- porosity amalgamated deformation bands that have slip surfaces on one or both sides. Probe permeameter measurements showed a per- meability decline from greater than 2000 to less than 0.1 md as the fault is approached. Whole-core analyses showed that fault core permeability is less than 1 md and individual deformation band permeability is about 1 md. Using these data, we calculated the bulk permeability of the fault zone. Calculated transverse perme- ability over length scales of 5–10 m is 30–40 md, approximately 1– 4% the value of the host rock. An inverse power mean calculation (representing a fault array with complex geometry) yielded total fault-zone permeabilities of 7–57 md.

abstract = {Deformation of a saturated rock in the field and laboratory may occur in a broad range of conditions, ranging from undrained to drained. The poromechanical response is often anisotropic, and in a brittle rock, closely related to preexisting and stress-induced cracks. This can be modeled as a rock matrix embedded with an anisotropic system of cracks. Assuming microisotropy, expressions for three of the poroelastic coefficients of a transversely isotropic rock were derived in terms of the crack density tensor. Together with published results for the five effective elastic moduli, this provides a complete micromechanical description of the eight independent poroelastic coefficients of such a cracked rock. Relatively simple expressions were obtained for the Skempton pore pressure tensor, which allow one to infer the crack density tensor from undrained measurement in the laboratory, and also to infer the Biot-Willis effective stress coefficients. The model assumes a dilute concentration of noninteractive penny-shaped cracks, and it shows good agreement with experimental data for Berea sandstone, with crack density values up to 0.6. Whereas predictions on the storage coefficient and normal components of the elastic stiffness tensor also seem reasonable, significant discrepancy between model and measurement was observed regarding the off-diagonal and shear components of the stiffness. A plausible model had been proposed for development of very strong anisotropy in the undrained response of a fault zone, and the model here placed geometric constraints on the associated fracture system.},

At much reduced e?ective stress, substantial ¯ow can occur parallel to the fabric such that anisotropy indices Ð calculated by dividing horizontal permeability by vertical permeability Ð increase by factors above 10. SEM observations show no intense particle alignments in the materials, but the presence of parallel oriented microfractures; mercury-intrusion porosimetry data indicate that this enhanced ¯ow is due to microfractures opening when favourably oriented. Such an e?ect is displayed as a distinctly bimodal pore-size distribution when intruded by mercury parallel to the fabric; identical samples with the fabric oriented perpendicular to intrusion direction show only unimodal pore-size distributions. While the results, at present, are only directly applicable to the shallow subsurface, it is proposed that directional bimodal pore-size distribution needs further investigation for deeper, more consolidated sediments in light of the potential rami{\textregistered}cations highlighted by the results.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Acoustic emission parameters such as amplitude may be related to geometric parameters such as crack size. We have analyzed catalogues of acoustic emission events recorded during compression tests in rock in terms of the information they give about the accumulated state of damage in a material. We combine this measured damage state with a model for the softening behaviour of cracked solids, and show that reasonable predictions of the mechanical behaviour are possible. Several strategies have to be used to allow for incomplete recording of the acoustic emissions. An independent calibration of the scaling relation between the acoustic emission parameters and the microcrack geometry remains outstanding, although the results here suggest constraints on the scaling relation. We show, however, that this quantitative approach is markedly superior to the more traditional methods of acoustic emission analysis in correlating the acoustic activity with the weakening of the material.},

abstract = {The behaviour of hydraulically 'tight' barrier rocks is a key determinant of the long-term integrity of potential underground storage sites for the waste products from low-carbon emission energy production technologies (including nuclear waste and CO2 captured from fossil fuels). Here we isolate the relationship between crack-induced permeability and porosity using an initially crack-free natural crystalline material. We vary secondary porosity from an initial value of zero, and demonstrate that the bulk permeability K varies with total connected porosity Phi above the percolation threshold Phi(c) as K = K-0(Phi - Phi(c))(n), where n = 3.8 +/- 0.4, i.e., similar to results obtained for higher porosity rocks, indicating universality of this scaling law. Close to the percolation threshold a modest change in total porosity from 1% to 5% or so results in a massive change in permeability of 7 orders of magnitude or more. The results are consistent with a continuum percolation model that reflects the microstructure of the pore/induced microcrack network in the natural material. Citation: Meredith, P. G., I. G.

abstract = {A combination of seismic refraction tomography, laboratory ultrasonic velocity measurements, and microstructural observations was used to study the shallow velocity structure of a strand of the San Andreas fault (SAF) just south of Littlerock, California. The examined site has a strongly asymmetric damage structure with respect to the SAF core. The conglomerates to the southwest show little to no damage, whereas a $\sim$100 m wide damage zone exists to the northeast with a $\sim$50 m wide zone of pulverized granite adjacent to the fault core. Seismic P-wave velocities of the damaged and pulverized granite were investigated over a range of scales. In situ seismic velocity imaging was performed on three overlapping profiles normal to the SAF with lengths of 350 m, 50 m, and 25 m. In the laboratory, ultrasonic velocities were measured on centimeter- to decimeter-sized samples taken along the in situ profiles. The samples were also investigated microstructurally. Micro-scale fracture damage intensifies with increasing proximity to the fault core, allowing a subdivision of the damage zone into several sections. Laboratory-derived velocities in each section display varying degrees of anisotropy, and combined with microfracture analysis suggest an evolving damage fabric. Pulverized rocks close to the fault exhibit a preferred fault-parallel orientation of microfractures, resulting in the lowest P-wave velocity orientated in fault-perpendicular direction. Closest to the fault, pulverized rocks exhibit a gouge-like fabric that is transitional to the fault core. Comparison of absolute velocities shows a scaling effect from field to laboratory for the intact rocks. A similar scaling effect is absent for the pulverized rocks, suggesting that they are dominated by micro-scale damage. Fault-parallel damage fabrics are consistent with existing models for pulverized-rock generation that predict strong dynamic reductions in fault-normal stress. Our observations provide important constraints for theoretical models and imaging fault damage properties at depth using remote methods.},

abstract = {Elucidation of the internal structure of fault zones is paramount for understanding their mechanical, seismological and hydraulic properties. In order to observe representative brittle fault zone structures, it is preferable that the fault be passively exhumed from seismogenic depths and the exposure must be in arid or semi-arid environments where the fragile rocks are not subject to extensive weathering. Field observations of two such faults are used to constrain their likely mechanical properties. One fault is the Carboneras fault in southeastern Spain, where the predominant country rocks are phyllosilicate-rich lithologies, and the other is part of the Atacama fault system in northern Chile, where faults pass through crystalline rocks of acidic to intermediate composition. The Carboneras fault is a left lateral fault with several tens of kilometres offset exhumed from approximately 4 km depth, and displays multiple strands of clay-bearing fault gouge, each several metres wide, that contain variably fractured lenses of protolithic mica schists. The strain is evenly distributed across the gouge layers, in accordance with the measured laboratory mechanical behaviour which shows predominantly strain hardening characteristics. The overall width of the fault zone is several hundred metres. Additionally, there are blocks of dolomitic material that are contained within the fault zones that show extremely localized deformation in the form of faults several centimetres wide. These are typically arranged at an angle of c. 20{degrees} to the overall fault plane. These differing types of fault rock products allow for the possibility of mixed mode' seismicity, with fault creep occurring along the strands of velocity strengthening clay-rich gouge, punctuated by small seismic events that nucleate on the velocity weakening localized faults within the dolomite blocks. The Caleta Coloso fault in northern Chile has a left-lateral offset of at least 5 km and was exhumed from 5-10 km depth. The fault core is represented by a 200-300 m wide zone of hydrothermally altered protocataclasite and ultracataclasite. This is surrounded by a zone of micro and macro-fractures on the order of 150 m thick. The fault core shows a heterogeneous distribution of strain, with alternate layers of ultracataclasite and lower strain material. The strain-weakening behaviour of crystalline rocks might be expected to produce highly localized zones of deformation, and thus the wide core zone must be a result of additional process such as precipitation strengthening or geometric irregularities along the fault plane.},

Understanding this permeability structure is paramount for predicting crustal fluid flow. We combine quantitative field and laboratory measurements to predict microfracture damage zone permeability in low-porosity granitic rocks as a function of distance from the fault core and displacement. Microfracture controlled matrix permeability exerts an increasingly dominant role on fluid flow with increasing depth. In the field we analysed the scaling relationships of microfracture densities surrounding strike-slip faults developed in granodiorite within the Atacama fault system in northern Chile. Displacements ranging over 5 orders of magnitude ($\sim$0.012-5000. m), allow the variation of microfracture damage with increasing distance from faults to be determined empirically as a function of displacement. We reproduce microfracture damage in the laboratory in a suite of triaxial deformation experiments by inducing cyclic damage in initially intact samples while continuously measuring permeability. Combining field and laboratory datasets through the microfracture density allows the permeability profile with distance from the fault to be predicted from fault displacement. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Subduction zone earthquakes can propagate to the surface causing large seafloor displacements resulting in tsunamis. This requires the earthquake to rupture through clay-rich sediments of the accretionary wedge, which are largely aseismic. As found previously, the frictional properties of a range of wet clays at low slip velocity are velocity strengthening, thus inhibiting earthquake nucleation. However, at high slip velocity the same materials weaken almost immediately resulting in a negligible critical slip weakening distance and fracture energy. We interpret this behaviour as rapid thermal pressurization of the pore fluid within the clay gouge. The lack of fracture energy can explain how a large rupture, propagating from depth, might not be arrested by clay-rich, velocity-strengthening sediments, as is commonly seen. The results suggest that generally, earthquakes may be difficult to nucleate on mature faults dominated by clay, but the propagation of earthquakes through these zones is energetically very favourable.},

abstract = {Damage surrounding the core of faults is represented by deformation on a range of scales from microfracturing of the rock matrix to macroscopic fracture networks. The spatial distribution and geometric characterization of damage at various scales can help to predict fault growth processes, subsequent mechanics, bulk hydraulic and seismological properties of a fault zone. Within the excellently exposed Atacama fault system, northern Chile, micro- and macroscale fracture densities and orientation surrounding strike-slip faults with well-constrained displacements ranging over nearly 5 orders of magnitude (∼0.12 m-5000 m) have been analyzed. Faults have been studied that cut granodiorite and have been passively exhumed from 6 to 10 km depth. This allows direct comparison of the damage surrounding faults of different displacements. The faults consist of a fault core and associated damage zone. Macrofractures in the damage zone are predominantly shear fractures orientated at high angles to the faults studied. They have a reasonably well-defined exponential decrease with distance from the fault core. Microfractures are a combination of open, healed, partially healed and fluid inclusion planes (FIPs). FIPs are the earliest set of fractures and show an exponential decrease in fracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Later microfractures do not show a clear relationship of microfracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Damage zone widths defined by the density of FIPs scale with fault displacement but appear to reach a maximum at a few km displacement. One fault, where damage was characterized on both sides of the fault core shows no damage asymmetry. All faults appear to have a critical microfracture density at the fault core/damage zone boundary that is independent of displacement. An empirical relationship for microfracture density distribution with displacement is presented. Preferred FIP orientations have a high angle to the fault close to the fault core and become more diffuse with distance. Models that predict off-fault damage such as a migrating process zone during fault formation, wear from geometrical irregularities and dynamic rupture are all consistent with our data. We conclude it is very difficult to distinguish between them on the basis of field data alone, at least within the limits of this study. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Detailed experimental studies of the development of permeability of crustal rock during deformation are essential in helping to understand fault mechanics and constrain larger-scale models that predict bulk fluid flow within the crust. Permeability is particularly enhanced in the damage zone of faults, where microfracture damage accumulates under stress less than that required for macroscopic failure. Experiments performed in the prefailure region can provide data directly applicable to these zones of microfracture damage surrounding faults. The strength, permeability, and pore fluid volume evolution of initially intact crystalline rocks (Cerro Cristales granodiorite and Westerly granite) under increasing differential load leading to macroscopic failure has been determined at water pore pressures of 50 MPa and varying effective pressures from 10 to 50 MPa. Permeability is seen to increase by up to, and over, 2 orders of magnitude prior to macroscopic failure, with the greatest increase seen at lowest effective pressures. Postfailure permeability is shown to be over 3 orders of magnitude higher than initial intact permeabilities and approaches the lower limit of predicted in situ bulk crustal permeabilities. Increasing amplitude cyclic loading tests show permeability-stress hysteresis, with high permeabilities maintained as differential stress is reduced and the greatest permeability increases are seen between 90 and 99% of the failure stress. Prefailure permeabilities are nearly 7 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by some high-pressure diffusive models suggesting that if these models are correct, microfracture matrix flow cannot dominate, and that bulk fluid flow must be dominated by larger-scale structures such as macrofractures. We present a model, based on our data, in which the permeability of a highly stressed fault tip process zone in low-permeability crystalline rocks increases by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Stress reduction related to the onward migration of the fault tip close damage zone cracks, while some permeability is maintained due to hysteresis from permanent microfracture damage.},

abstract = {Predicting the effects of small-scale faults and fractures on reservoir behaviour requires a definition of their spatial distribution, orientation and mode. Elastic dislocation (ED) theory can predict the distribution of displacement, strain and stress in the rock volume surrounding major faults, from mapping of fault geometry and slip distribution in 3D seismic-reflection datasets. The intensity of small-scale faulting can be related to the predicted local strain, or the degree to which the shear stresses exceeded the rock failure envelope. We illustrate the methodology with three case studies: (i) a relatively-simple thrust anticline from Venezuela, where hydrocarbons are trapped in Pliocene sandstones within the faulted hanging wall anticline; (ii) the Gullfaks Field and of the North Sea; and (iii) the Miskar Field, offshore Tunisia, where large seismically mapped normal faults are forward-modelled to predict small-scale fault characteristics for comparison with detailed interpretation and seismic attribute analysis. Key requirements for the development of a robust predictive model of the small-scale fault and fracture network are a geometrically consistent framework model, judicious choice of mechanical properties, and a reasonable estimate of regional background strain.},

abstract = {Natural earthquake slip profiles have a generic triangular shape which the available rupture dynamics models fail to reproduce. Long‐term faults are embedded in long‐damaged crustal material, and the properties of the long‐term damage vary both across and along the faults. We examine the effects of the predamaged state of the medium on the earthquake slip distributions. We simulate long‐term damage by the decrease in the elastic modulus of the medium around the fault. We model the dynamic crack‐like rupture of a slip‐weakening planar, right‐lateral strike‐slip fault, and search which geometries and elastic properties of the long‐term damage produce a triangular slip profile on the rupture. We find that such a profile is produced only when a laterally heterogeneous preexisting damage zone surrounds the ruptured fault. The highest on‐fault slip develops in the most compliant region of the damage zone, and not necessarily above the earthquake hypocenter. The coseismic slip decreases in zones of stiffer damage. The amount of coseismic slip dissipated in the damage zone is large, at least 25–40% of maximum on‐fault slip, and can occur over large distances from the fault. Our study thus emphasizes that off‐fault preexisting damage should be considered for an accurate description of earthquake ruptures. It also motivates a reformulation of the available earthquake source inversion models since most of them do not include the inelastic deformations that occur in the near field of the earthquake ruptures.},

The study of strain partitioning in the S{\'{e}}chilienne landslide (France) provides a unique insight into this sensitivity. Here we show with hydromechanical modeling that a significant part of the observed landslide motions and associated seismicity may be caused by poroelastic strain below the landslide, induced by groundwater table variations. In the unstable volume near the surface, calculated strain and rupture may be controlled by stress transfer and friction weakening above the phreatic zone and reproduce well high-motion zone characteristics measured by geodesy and geophysics. The key model parameters are friction weakening and the position of groundwater level, which is sufficiently constrained by field data to support the physical validity of the model.

abstract = {In Matsushiro, central Japan, a series of more than 700,000 earthquakes occurred over a 2-year period (1965–1967) associated with a strike-slip faulting sequence. This swarm of earthquakes resulted in ground surface deformations, cracking of the topsoil, and enhanced spring outflows with changes in chemical compositions, as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing. Previous investigations of the Matsushiro earthquake swarm have suggested that migration of underground water and/or magma may have had a strong influence on the swarm activity. In this study, employing coupled multiphase flow and geomechanical modeling, we show that observed crustal deformations and seismicity could have been driven by upwelling of deep CO2-rich fluids around the intersection of two fault zones: the regional east Nagano earthquake fault and the conjugate Matsushiro fault. We show that the observed spatial evolution of seismicity along the two faults and magnitudes surface uplift are convincingly explained by a few megapascals of pressurization from the upwelling fluid within the critically stressed crust, a crust under a strike-slip stress regime near the frictional strength limit. Our analysis indicates that the most important cause for triggering of seismicity during the Matsushiro swarm was the fluid pressurization with the associated reduction in effective stress and strength in fault segments that were initially near critically stressed for shear failure. Moreover, our analysis indicates that a 2-order-of-magnitude permeability enhancement in ruptured fault segments may be necessary to match the observed time evolution of surface uplift. We conclude that our hydromechanical modeling study of the Matsushiro earthquake swarm shows a clear connection between earthquake rupture, deformation, stress, and permeability changes, as well as large-scale fluid flow related to degassing of CO2 in the shallow seismogenic crust. Thus our study provides further evidence of the important role of deep fluid sources in earthquake fault dynamics and surface deformations.},

abstract = {The interaction between mechanical deformation and fluid flow in fault zones gives rise to a host of coupled hydromechanical processes fundamental to fault instability, induced seismicity, and associated fluid migration. In this paper, we discuss these coupled processes in general and describe three modeling approaches that have been considered to analyze fluid flow and stress coupling in fault-instability processes. First, fault hydromechanical models were tested to investigate fault behavior using different mechanical modeling approaches, including slip interface and finite-thickness elements with isotropic or anisotropic elasto-plastic constitutive models. The results of this investigation showed that fault hydromechanical behavior can be appropriately represented with the least complex alternative, using a finite-thickness element and isotropic plasticity. We utilized this pragmatic approach coupled with a strain-permeability model to study hydromechanical effects on fault instability during deep underground injection of CO2. We demonstrated how such a modeling approach can be applied to determine the likelihood of fault reactivation and to estimate the associated loss of CO2from the injection zone. It is shown that shear-enhanced permeability initiated where the fault intersects the injection zone plays an important role in propagating fault instability and permeability enhancement through the overlying caprock. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We simulate CO2 injection into a reservoir-caprock system bounded by a subvertical normal fault subjected to different extensional stress regimes and over a range of initial fault permeability values. For our assumed system and injection rate, the simulation results show that sudden stress drop and fault slip primarily initi- ated along the fault portion intersecting the storage reservoir after a few months of injection when a sufficiently high res- ervoir pressure has been reached.

abstract = {Fractures are ubiquitous on all scales in crustal rocks. The investigation of fractures and their influence on physical and transport properties of rocks is therefore essential for understanding of many key problems in seismology, volcanology and rock engineering. In crystalline rocks, pore water is primarily stored in and migrates through networks of cracks and fractures at all scales. It is therefore essential to know how fluid flow in such fracture networks responds to the elevated pressures found at depth. Here, we report results from an investigation of changes in fluid permeability, and associated changes in P-wave and S-wave velocities, at elevated effective pressure for intact, macro-fractured and micro-fractured samples of Seljadur basalt. In all cases, permeability decreases and both wave velocities increase with increasing effective pressure. Permeability decreases were smallest in the intact material (from approximately 10-19m2to 3×10-20m2), intermediate in the micro-fractured material (from approximately 5×10-17m2to 1×10-17m2) and largest in the macro-fractured material (from approximately 3×10-15m2to 9×10-19m2). For a material containing both micro-fractures and macro-fractures, the closure of macro-fractures dominated the permeability reduction at low pressure, with the closure of micro-fractures exerting an increasing influence at higher pressure. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Because of the critically stressed nature of the upper crust, the injection of large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into shallow geological reservoirs can trigger seismicity and induce ground deformations when the injection increases the fluid pressure in the vicinity of potentially seismic faults. The increased fluid pressure reduces the strength against fault slip, allowing the stored elastic energy to be released in seismic events that can produce felt ground accelerations. Here, we seek to explore the likelihood ground motions induced by a CO2 injection using hydromechanical modelling with multiphase fluid flow and dynamic rupture, including fault-frictional weakening. We extend the previous work of Cappa and Rutqvist, in which activation of a normal fault at critical stress may be possible for fast rupture nucleating by localized increase in fluid pressure and large decrease in fault friction. In this paper, we include seismic wave propagation generated by the rupture. For our assumed system and injection rate, simulations show that after a few days of injection, a dynamic fault rupture of few centimetres nucleates at the base of the CO2 reservoir and grows bilaterally, both toward the top of the reservoir and outside. The rupture is asymmetric and affects a larger zone below the reservoir where the rupture is self-propagating (without any further pressure increase) as a result of fault-strength weakening. The acceleration and deceleration of the rupture generate waves and result in ground accelerations ([$\sim$]0.1-0.6 g) consistent with observed ground motion records. The maximum ground acceleration is obtained near the fault, and horizontal accelerations are generally markedly higher than vertical accelerations.},

abstract = {P>Fluid pressurization, a possible mechanism of fault weakening, exerts a critical control on earthquake rupture in the upper crust. One cause for this control is the presence of high fluid pressures inside the fault zone. However, the precise mechanisms relating high fluid pressures and fault rupture remain unclear. Here, we use 2-D hydromechanical models to show that effective stress changes induced by a transient pulse of fluid pressure along a fault zone with spatially variable material properties-conditions that are representative of natural faults-can be sufficient to produce large slip in the fault core, and fracturing in the surrounding damage volume. Rupture properties outside the limited source region are examined for ranges of values of the degree of material contrast across the fault. Our results indicate that the slip dimension is highly influenced by the contrasts of permeability and rigidity across the fault zone components, from the fault core through the various subzones of the fractured damage zone and to the less fractured host rock. Moreover, high fluid pressures may also develop locally off the narrow fault core, preferentially into the more permeable and less rigid parts of the damage zone, where the deformation is plastic, highlighting a possible mechanism for off-fault rupture. Finally, on faults with hydromechanical heterogeneities at the scale of the internal structure, the fluid pressure and rupture are highly asymmetric with propagation in a preferred direction, that is the more permeable and compliant material of the fault zones.},

The majority of slip at the surface is localized to a clay-rich gouge fault core 8-10. cm in width, surrounded by a coarsening outwards fault breccias up to 3. m wide. Fault damage is highly asymmetric with respect to the slipping zone. The granite south of the fault has a pulverized damage zone up to 200. m wide, while the rhyolite to the north has only about 3. m wide non-pulverized fault breccia. The degree of pulverization in the granite decreases approximately logarithmically with normal distance from the slip zone. The highly fractured pulverized rocks exhibit several distinct textural characteristics. In thin section, grains appear to be highly comminuted but the original grain shapes and margins are recognizable. Microfractures tend to be tensile in no preferred orientation. Grain fragments display little to no rotation and lack evidence of in-situ shear. Consequently, at macroscale the rocks appear to preserve original granitic textures, despite being highly fractured and friable. The observed pulverization and rock damage asymmetry are most consistent with generation mechanism involving ruptures on a bimaterial interface with statistically preferred propagation direction, leading to damage primarily on the side with higher seismic velocity at depth. This is supported by laboratory measurements of P-wave ultrasonic velocities on intact samples which indicate that the granites have consistently higher velocity than the rhyolite with increasing confining pressure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Studies of fault rock permeabilities advance the understanding of fluid migration patterns around faults and contribute to predictions of fault stability. In this study a new model is proposed combining brittle deformation structures formed during faulting, with fluid flow through pores. It assesses the impact of faulting on the permeability anisotropy of porous sandstone, hypothesising that the formation of fault related micro-scale deformation structures will alter the host rock porosity organisation and create new permeability pathways. Core plugs and thin sections were sampled around a normal fault and oriented with respect to the fault plane. Anisotropy of permeability was determined in three orientations to the fault plane at ambient and confining pressures. Results show that permeabilities measured parallel to fault dip were up to 10 times higher than along fault strike permeability. Analysis of corresponding thin sections shows elongate pores oriented at a low angle to the maximum principal palaeo-stress ($\sigma$1) and parallel to fault dip, indicating that permeability anisotropy is produced by grain scale deformation mechanisms associated with faulting. Using a soil mechanics 'void cell model' this study shows how elongate pores could be produced in faulted porous sandstone by compaction and reorganisation of grains through shearing and cataclasis. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We present the influence of mineralogy and microstructure on the seismic velocity anisotropy of evaporites. Bulk elastic properties and seismic velocities are calculated for a suite of 20 natural evaporite samples, which consist mainly of halite, anhydrite, and gypsum. They exhibit strong fabrics as a result of tectonic and diagenetic processes. Sample mineralogy and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) were obtained with the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique and the data used for seismic velocity calculations. Bulk seismic properties for polymineralic evaporites were evaluated with a rock recipe approach. Ultrasonic velocity measurements were also taken on cube shaped samples to assess the contribution of grain-scale shape preferred orientation (SPO) to the total seismic anisotropy. The sample results suggest that CPO is responsible for a significant fraction of the bulk seismic properties, in agreement with observations from previous studies. Results from the rock recipe indicate that increasing modal proportion of anhydrite grains can lead to a greater seismic anisotropy of a halite-dominated rock. Conversely, it can lead to a smaller seismic anisotropy degree of a gypsum-dominated rock until an estimated threshold proportion after which anisotropy increases again. The difference between the predicted anisotropy due to CPO and the anisotropy measured with ultrasonic velocities is attributed to the SPO and grain boundary effects in these evaporites.},

abstract = {When continents break apart, the rifting is sometimes accompanied by the production of large volumes of molten rock. The total melt volume, however, is uncertain, because only part of it has erupted at the surface. Furthermore, the cause of the magmatism is still disputed-specifically, whether or not it is due to increased mantle temperatures. We recorded deep-penetration normal-incidence and wide-angle seismic profiles across the Faroe and Hatton Bank volcanic margins in the northeast Atlantic. Here we show that near the Faroe Islands, for every 1 km along strike, 360-400 km(3) of basalt is extruded, while 540-600 km(3) is intruded into the continent-ocean transition. We find that lower-crustal intrusions are focused mainly into a narrow zone approximately 50 km wide on the transition, although extruded basalts flow more than 100 km from the rift. Seismic profiles show that the melt is intruded into the lower crust as sills, which cross-cut the continental fabric, rather than as an 'underplate' of 100 per cent melt, as has often been assumed. Evidence from the measured seismic velocities and from igneous thicknesses are consistent with the dominant control on melt production being increased mantle temperatures, with no requirement for either significant active small-scale mantle convection under the rift or the presence of fertile mantle at the time of continental break-up, as has previously been suggested for the North Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Porosity and permeability are notoriously difficult to predict in carbonates, especially prior to drilling when there is a lack of direct petrophysical data. The aim of this paper is to document the initial results of an integrated outcrop and laboratory study designed to investigate the relationships between pore systems and acoustic velocities in faulted Oligo-Miocene carbonates on the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo. Depositional facies is shown to have a significant effect, with velocities in grain-dominated carbonates up to 1000 m s21 higher than those in micrite-dominated carbonates. Based on outcrop structural data, the fault zones can be separated into three architectural components: a fault core; an intensely damaged zone; and a weakly damaged zone, with the last passing into undamaged protolith. Our data suggest that only the fault core component can be identified using porosity-velocity data, with P-wave velocity (Vp) values of 5000-6500 m s21 at helium porosities of less than 5%. Our study is novel in that the prediction of elastic properties and acoustic velocities across fault zones is anticipated by linking laboratory-scale measurements with seismic-scale predictions through quantitative rock physics modelling. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2015.},

abstract = {This contribution describes the development of an inverse method to extract fault slip and fault geometry from subsurface horizons derived from seismic reflection datasets. The inversion process uses non-linear minimisation together with a forward model using elastic dislocation (ED) theory. The forward model calculates subsurface vertical displacements from fault parameters such as fault slip, dip, length and width for planar, listric or seismically observed fault geometries. Vertical subsurface displacements are measured at selected stratigraphic horizons from seismic depth sections, and act as observations for the inversion process. The non-linear inversion uses a standard procedure (Powell's method) to minimise an objective function (misfit parameter). The method has been tested using synthetic data generated by theoretical forward models. The inverse method can successfully recover slip distributions and non-planar, including listric, fault geometries. The method has also been applied to stratigraphic horizons derived from seismic reflection data. Fault slip and fault geometry derived from the inverse method are consistent with direct seismic interpretations, and are reproducible and geologically realistic. This inverse method provides a useful complement to conventional subjective seismic interpretations of fault slip and geometry. ED theory together with the retrieved fault parameters from the application of inverse theory may be used to determine strains for fracture prediction. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geomechanical models based on linear elasticity have been used to predict the mode and distribution of subseismic fractures around larger faults. These models can be tested against field observations of surface breaks (fractures) formed in the aftermath of large earthquakes. This paper presents forward models based on elastic dislocation theory of the deformation due to the M s 7.3 earthquake at El Asnam, Algeria in 1980. Using fault parameters from previous geodetic studies to define a set of larger faults, our models calculate the deformation field in the surrounding rock volume. We compare predicted strain and stress fields with the surface deformation measured in the area following the 1980 earthquake. Using a combination of the redistributed elastic dislocation stress due to slip on the major faults and a small component of overburden stress, the models successfully predict normal faults and tensile fractures in the hanging wall of the reverse fault system. Orientations of the predicted faults vary along strike of the fault system, being parallel to the main reverse fault in the south but oblique to it along the central segment, agreeing with observed surface breaks. The results of our forward modeling are not sensitive to the magnitude or direction of a regional tectonic stress. The predicted fractures are controlled by the near-field, short-term redistributed stresses due to coseismic slip. The agreement between modeled and measured deformation patterns adds confidence in the use of elastic dislocation theory to accurately predict small faults generated by coseismic slip on large faults.},

The geometry of these microcracks\nis primarily controlled by the interaction of the imposed stress field\nwith the mineral elastic properties. However, the effects of anisotropic\nelastic properties of minerals on brittle fracture are not well\nunderstood. This study examines the effects of elastic anisotropy of\nquartz on the geometry of brittle fracture and related acoustic\nemissions (AE) developed during indentation experiments on single\ncrystals at ambient pressure and temperature. A Hertzian cone crack\ndeveloped during blunt indentation of a single crystal of flawless\nBrazilian quartz parallel to the c axis shows geometric deviation away\nfrom predictions based on the isotropic case, consistent with trigonal\nsymmetry. The visible cone crack penetration depth varies from 3 to 5 mm\nand apical angle from 53 degrees to 40 degrees. Electron backscatter\ndiffraction (EBSD) mapping of the crack tip shows that fracturing\ninitiates along a similar to 40 mu m wide process zone, comprising\ndamage along overlapping en echelon high-index crystallographic planes,\nshown by discrete bands of reduced electron backscatter pattern (EBSP)\nquality (band contrast). Coalescence of these surfaces results in a\nstepped fracture morphology. Monitoring of AE during indentation reveals\nthat the elastic anisotropy of quartz has a significant effect on AE\nlocation and focal mechanisms. Ninety-four AE events were recorded\nduring indentation and show an increasing frequency with increasing\nload. They correspond to the development of subsidiary concentric cracks\nperipheral to the main cone crack. The strong and complex anisotropy in\nseismic velocity (similar to 28% V(p), similar to 43% V(s) with\ntrigonal symmetry) resulted in inaccurate and high uncertainty in AE\nlocations using Geiger location routine with an isotropic velocity\nmodel. This problem was overcome by using a relative (master event)\nlocation algorithm that only requires a priori knowledge of the velocity\nstructure within the source volume. The AE location results correlate\nreasonably well to the extent of the observed cone crack. Decomposition\nof AE source mechanisms of the Geiger relocated events shows dominantly\nend-member behavior between tensile and compressive vector dipole\nevents, with some double-couple dominated events and no purely tensile\nor compressive events. The same events located by the master event\nalgorithm yield greater percentage of vector dipole components and no\ndouble-couple events, indicating that AE source mechanism solutions can\ndepend on AE location accuracy, and therefore, relocation routine that\nis utilized. Calculations show that the crystallographic anisotropy of\nquartz causes apparent deviation of the moment tensors away from\ndouble-couple and pure tensile/compressive sources consistent with the\nobservations. Preliminary modeling of calcite anisotropy shows a\nresponse distinct from quartz, indicating that the effects of anisotropy\non interpreting AE are complex and require detailed further study.},

abstract = {Faults in brittle rock are shear fractures formed through the interaction and coalescence of many tensile microcracks(1-3). The geometry of these microcracks and their surrounding elastic stress fields control the orientation of the final shear fracture surfaces(3,4). The classic Coulomb - Mohr failure criterion(5) predicts the development of two conjugate ( bimodal) shear planes that are inclined at an acute angle to the axis of maximum compressive stress. This criterion, however, is incapable of explaining the three-dimensional polymodal fault patterns that are widely observed in rocks(6-9). Here we show that the elastic stress around tensile microcracks in three dimensions promotes a mutual interaction that produces brittle shear planes oriented obliquely to the remote principal stresses, and can therefore account for observed polymodal fault patterns. Our microcrack interaction model is based on the three-dimensional solution of Eshelby(10,11), unlike previous models(4,12) that employed two-dimensional approximations. Our model predicts that shear fractures formed by the coalescence of interacting mode I cracks will be inclined at a maximum of 268 to the axes of remote maximum and intermediate compression. An improved understanding of brittle shear failure in three dimensions has important implications for earthquake seismology and rock-mass stability, as well as fluid migration in fractured rocks(13).},

abstract = {Subducting slabs experience deformation and metamorphism as they descend into the upper mantle. The presence of hydrous minerals gained through the interaction with sea water at mid-ocean ridges, transform faults or the outer rise ensures that dehydration reactions will be important at deeper levels. We describe field evidence for brittle hydrofracture in previously subducted rocks from the Western Alps, with a free aqueous fluid phase produced by dehydration reactions in the host blueschists and serpentinites. The protracted history of dehydration reactions, ductile deformation, fluid flow and brittle vein formation in these rocks implies that fluid-filled cracks are continuously produced within the dehydration window. The presence of abundant fluid-filled cracks at these depths has important implications for the seismic anisotropy generated within slabs, which has largely been overlooked. The effects of fluid-filled crack damage on the elastic properties of a blueschist and serpentinite within the slab at depth have been modelled, and show a significant rotation of the fast axes of P and S1 waves to be trench-parallel for receiving stations in the forearc, above the dehydrating portion of the slab. This model provides an alternative explanation for supra-subduction zone seismic anisotropy that does not require high-stress, high-water conditions, or trench-parallel flow in the supra-subduction zone mantle wedge. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Low angle normal faults (LANFs) are commonly associated with high-angle normal faults, high pore fluid pressures and foliated fault cores. Explanations for LANF slip based on high pore fluid pressure critically depend on stress rotations in the fault core zone, which have been based on an assumption of isotropy. Anisotropy fundamentally changes the coupling between pore fluid pressure and effective stress. The response of saturated fault core rocks in LANFs can be explored by combining the Effective Medium Theory with anisotropic poroelasticity. The nucleation and evolution of LANFs are investigated in a framework of local changes in rock properties and the interaction of a pressurised pore fluid with intrinsic (lithological) and extrinsic (damage) anisotropies. This quantitative approach enables comparison with detailed field and laboratory measurements of fault rock properties. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Existing models of brittle shear failure are unable to account for three-dimensional deformation involving the development of polymodal sets of fractures. Motivated by field observations of contemporaneous arrays of quadrimodal faults and deformation bands, we use an idealised micromechanical model to explain how brittle shear fractures can form oblique to all three remote principal stresses. We model tensile microcracks as finite ellipsoidal voids, subjected to small opening strains, in a linear isotropic elastic matrix. The geometry of the tensile stress lobes around the ends of an isolated microcrack promotes the en echelon interaction of neighbouring cracks with respect to the prescribed crack orientation. Coalescence of these interacting crack arrays into a through-going composite fracture surface leads to a brittle shear failure plane oriented obliquely to all three coordinate axes and all three remote principal stresses. Experimental evidence supports the idea that composite shear fractures can propagate in-plane through the coalescence of many constituent tensile microcracks. Our new model, based on the 3-D geometry of the elastic stress field around a mode I crack, can explain the oblique orientations of polymodal faults formed in a triaxially compressive stress field. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Slip on unfavourably oriented faults with respect to a remotely applied stress is well documented and implies that faults such as the San Andreas fault and low-angle normal faults are weak when compared to laboratory-measured frictional strength. If high pore pressure within fault zones is the cause of such weakness, then stress reorientation within or close to a fault is necessary to allow sufficient fault weakening without the occurrence of hydrofracture. From field observations of a major tectonic fault, and using laboratory experiments and numerical modelling, here we show that stress rotation occurs within the fractured damage zone surrounding faults. In particular, we find that stress rotation is considerable for unfavourably oriented 'weak' faults. In the 'weak' fault case, the damage-induced change in elastic properties provides the necessary stress rotation to allow high pore pressure faulting without inducing hydrofracture.},

This integrated approach, should be used in an interdisciplinary way by farmers, veterinarians, nutrition advisors and other relevant professionals for the improvement of animal health and welfare and producer profitability. The key areas that form the basis for this approach are body condition score management, negative energy balance, hypocalcaemia, rumen health and trace element status. Monitoring criteria are described for each of these key areas, which when considered collectively, will facilitate the assessment of dairy cow health with regard to clinical and subclinical disease. The criteria, which are informed by published scientific literature, are based on farm management and environmental factors, clinical data, milk production records, dietary analysis, and assessment of blood and liver concentrations of various metabolites or trace elements. The aim is to review the efficacy of production disease control measures currently in place, and if necessary to modify them or formulate new ones. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Our understanding of earthquakes and faulting processes has developed significantly since publication of the successful first edition of this book in 1990. This revised edition has therefore been thoroughly up-dated whilst maintaining and developing the two major themes of the first edition. The first of these themes is the connection between fault and earthquake mechanics, including fault scaling laws, the nature of fault populations, and how these result from the processes of fault growth and interaction. The second major theme is the central role of the rate-state friction laws in earthquake mechanics, which provide a unifying framework within which a wide range of faulting phenomena can be interpreted. With the inclusion of two chapters explaining brittle fracture and rock friction from first principles, this book is written at a level which will appeal to graduate students and research scientists in the fields of seismology, physics, geology, geodesy and rock mechanics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. The Authors. We present a comparative study of crack damage evolution in dry sandstone under both conventional ($\sigma$ 1 > $\sigma$ 2 = $\sigma$ 3 ), and true triaxial ($\sigma$ 1 > $\sigma$ 2 > $\sigma$ 3 ) stress conditions using results from measurements made on cubic samples deformed in three orthogonal directions with independently controlled stress paths. To characterize crack damage, we measured the changes in ultrasonic compressional and shear wave velocities in the three principal directions, together with the bulk acoustic emission (AE) output contemporaneously with stress and strain. We use acoustic wave velocities to model comparative crack densities and orientations. In essence, we create two end-member crack distributions; one displaying cylindrical transverse isotropy (conventional triaxial) and the other planar transverse isotropy (true triaxial). Under the stress conditions in our experiments we observed an approximately fivefold decrease in the number of AE events between the conventional and true triaxial cases. When taken together, the AE data, the velocities, and the crack density data indicate that the intermediate principal stress suppresses the total number of cracks and restricts their growth to orientations subnormal to the minimum principal stress. However, the size of individual cracks remains essentially constant, controlled by the material grain size. Crack damage is only generated when the differential stress exceeds some threshold value. Cyclic loading experiments show that further damage commences only when that previous maximum differential stress is exceeded, regardless of the mean stress, whether this is achieved by increasing the maximum principal stress or by decreasing the minimum principal stress.},

abstract = {The fabric of pores in sedimentary rocks around fault zones can be subject to significant modification. Knowledge of how pore fabrics vary during and after faulting is important for understanding how rocks transmit fluids around fault zones, and can help to predict mechanical instability due to changes in pore fluid pressure. Datasets detailing the geometry of pore fabrics in faulted porous rocks are lacking. This paper describes pore fabrics quantified from two outcrops of normally faulted sandstone. The porosity and the size, shape and geometry of pores were quantified from core plugs and thin sections. Results were mapped within a framework of the faults to better illustrate how these datasets may be used to improve understanding of fluid flow around fault zones. Results from a mature, quartz-rich arenite show a change in pore fabric from pores oriented horizontally and parallel to laminations to pores oriented at a low angle to $\sigma$1. Pore fabrics quantified from a clay-rich, quartz sub-arkose changed from moderate aspect ratio pores with no preferred orientation, to high aspect ratio pores oriented dominantly sub-parallel to the fault surface. Permeabilities measured on corresponding core plugs showed anisotropy of permeability with maximum permeability oriented down fault dip around both faults.},

@article{Kimura1990,
abstract = {The patterns of fractures in deformed rocks are rarely uniform or random. Fracture orientations, sizes, and spatial distributions often exhibit some kind of order. In detail, relationships may exist among the different fracture attributes, e.g. small fractures dominated by one orientation, larger fractures by another. These relationships are important because the mechanical (e.g. strength, anisotropy) and transport (e.g. fluids, heat) properties of rock depend on these fracture attributes and patterns. This paper describes FracPaQ, a new open source, cross-platform toolbox to quantify fracture patterns, including distributions in fracture attributes and their spatial variation. Software has been developed to quantify fracture patterns from 2-D digital images, such as thin section micrographs, geological maps, outcrop or aerial photographs or satellite images. The toolbox comprises a suite of MATLAB™ scripts based on previously published quantitative methods for the analysis of fracture attributes: orientations, lengths, intensity, density and connectivity. An estimate of permeability in 2-D is made using a parallel plate model. The software provides an objective and consistent methodology for quantifying fracture patterns and their variations in 2-D across a wide range of length scales, rock types and tectonic settings. The implemented methods presented are inherently scale independent, and a key task where applicable is analysing and integrating quantitative fracture pattern data from micro-to macro-scales. The toolbox was developed in MATLAB™ and the source code is publicly available on GitHub™ and the Mathworks™ FileExchange. The code runs on any computer with MATLAB installed, including PCs with Microsoft Windows, Apple Macs with Mac OS X, and machines running different flavours of Linux. The application, source code and sample input files are available in open repositories in the hope that other developers and researchers will optimise and extend the functionality for the benefit of the wider community.},
